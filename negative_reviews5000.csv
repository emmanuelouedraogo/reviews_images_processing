qLsIKGtip5HGsz22dyA94A,OrKXONcsflIzIvijzLgc9Q,ZDdNEwBENLXBT3jjQD5STQ,2.0,0,1,0,"I got the Soon Du Bu with Seafood. My friend got the Dol Sot Bibimbop with beef. I went for lunch. The soup was good, but it wasn't very spicy at all. I'm not even sure I felt any burn. I'll admit I tend to eat spicier things than my friends, but I've had Korean that made me tear up a bit before...so I was disappointed. The seafood was just that...unnamed pile of stuff. It was all good, as was the tofu. The shrimps come whole...so head, legs, shell and such. I'm not even sure how you're supposed to eat that out of a soup so I took them out and cracked them open feeling quite the primitive in the process.

My friend's Bibimbop looked beautiful. The flavor however was a bit bland. It needed...something. Because the bowl was so hot, and probably also due to user error to a certain extent, the rice at the bottom burned together and created a bit of a crispy rice pancake which while good with some cuisine styles (think Indian and Arab), isn't terribly delicious with this type of rice. The whole bowl had a bit of a burnt taste to it. She wasn't too happy with it.

I may go back to try the tacos, but they're kind of expensive...the only thing that kept me from going in the first place was the $15 minimum for cards which is pretty absurd.",2016-03-03 17:33:57

On an early Saturday morning, my mother and I pull off to begin some errands the vehicle begins to make a rattling noise. We pull over get out and it sounds like someone is playing the Drumline soundtrack underneath the hood. At 11:46 I tell my mom, we need to take this vehicle back and get it switched. Now of course this location is closing at 12. We call just to see if the switch can take place at another location. *insert image of my rubbing my temples and nothing is improving* I speak with who will be an unnamed gentleman (after all this yelp is meant to vent not attack or put anyone on blast), and express the issue to him. He stated we have no cars here and we will need to call Cherry Hill. WE? As in me? Bitch I know you lying. If you don't call that other branch to confirm they have something cuz their vehicle sound like it's on the highway to the Upper Room. I gathered the impression that when it was my mother speaking he felt he could dismiss her in an effort to hang up and meet his 12p clock out time. Once I got on the phone with some base and ""I wish tf you would"", the tone changed. After being placed on hold, big surprise, cherry hill doesn't have any cars. I say, ""well I guess it's a good thing we didn't drive straight there, huh? I'll wait while you check other branches. Thank you.""

Chris wanted a vanilla flavored ice cream but got confused with their menu and ordered the wrong thing but he ate it anyways. I tried their mint ice cream which was very minty than what I was expecting of being subtle. This felt like a burst of eucalyptus oil and mint leaves in one to confuse my taste buds. I ate half of my ice cream then decided it was enough. The decorations and the furniture is intriguing in its own way. One thing I did enjoy is the community involvement. They had a poster that was trying to raise money for Haiti. They also had framed artwork that was painted by different artists as well as children that being sold displayed and sold.

But no more.  Tonight our waitress suggested the Mustard Encrusted Chicken Breasts.  It arrived quickly, with a hard roll on the plate.  She came back and asked how I liked the meal...I had just started eating my vegetables so said it was ok.  But when I tried to eat the small flat 1 inch high disk of chicken, I had to saw & saw and then chew & chew & unceremoniously swallow it.  I really wanted some butter to soften the hard white flour roll to eat with my meal, but the waitress did not return till too late.  With each bite of the chicken 'briquette' I would inspect the remaining portion on my plate---I told my friend I saw no blood on it in the darkened restaurant.  He tasted my chicken and he was sure glad he ordered the fish N chips.  Finally I asked another waitress to get our waitress and I showed her by vigorously sawing back and forth 4X in one spot, how tough and rubbery the smaller 'circle' of chicken was, but that I had not seen any blood.  (Years ago I had tasted rubbery chicken at a KFC near my home--it was red inside and barely cooked.)  She said she would ask the chef about it;--turns out Dawson's has a new chicken breast supplier and these need to be tenderized.  Well, obviously my piece wasn't 'tenderized'.  She said the manager would discount my chicken dinner and I agreed.  The round disk I had attempted to eat came to the table hidden under a better-breaded larger and thinner piece that I had not tried, so I put it in my to-go box.   She discounted the chicken dinner a few dollars.  After she brought the discounted bill, our waitress snapped up my friend's to-go box with his fish in it, saying, ""You WON'T be wanting this!""  I said, ""That box is HIS!""  She dropped his and grabbed mine, saying, 'We can't discount it and let you take it.""  (Great--$10 for vegetables and a hard roll and chewing and chewing from the smaller (hidden) piece of poultry I was served--a dog's chicken chew toy!)  I said that I had intended to take it home and to cook it thoroughly to see if undercooking was the problem, before she came back with a revised bill of a few dollars off.  She said they couldn't discount it and also let me take it home to attempt to better cook it---though she saw the problem with sawing rigorously back and forth through the rubbery chicken just to get a single piece on the fork! NOT very appetizing to have to continually inspect what I attempted to eat!  I left a tip and went up to the cashier to pay for my non-meal.  It was there that I saw she had added a $5.37 ""gratuity"".  I said, ""What is this?"" and told her I had left a tip at the table.  So the young manager returned to the back of the restaurant to remove that charge.  I told them I had never had such a horrible dining experience and would not be back.  And I certainly will tell my family and friends, and my son so that he can inform his friends.  I have been served more professionally at fast food restaurants!  Will I eat again at Dawson's?

I walked in on Halloween and I had to stand outside as the line was that long. Needless to say, I was able to get my order in about 30 minutes as it was a gluten-free crust and they made a mistake and had to remake it. 

However, recently I was in and there were only three people waiting for their pizza. I placed my order. Three people who came in after I had placed an order and ordered. Got their pizza ahead of me. 

And, yes there were people who came in to pick up their online order I totally get that. But I have an issue with people who walk in after me and place an order and still get their pizza first.

I had to go up and remind them. The owner was like where did that pizza crust go. Even after I asked it still took another 10 minutes to get my pizza. I waited for my order for over 45 minutes. They need to have some kind of system so that they are making orders in order of how they receive them. 

Not to mention there was another lady there who had to do the same thing. She had to go up and ask where her order was. It is understandable when the place is jumping and busy like on Halloween but not when it is just a regular day.",2019-12-19 05:37:50

The issues started when some of the entrees came out and left many at the table waiting for food while everyone else ate. It took awhile for all of the food to arrive and then some was sent back because it was cold. Management apologized and brought a good array of deserts to make up for the screwup.

I hope I don't get sick from this. The turkey is also very dry and they put too much Dijon mustard on the bread that it's overpowering. The bread is dry and hard to chew. 
Attention to Management: please try to use fresh greens in your sandwich. Also, adding tomatoes to this would be a nice touch to balance the saltiness from all the mustard. Thanks.

Update in response to the owner: I understand that the greens will wilt under the heat, but are they supposed to turn yellow too? I don't know how fresh the arugula was considering greens, if not used frequently, can go bad. A lot of people (whether making the food or consuming it) don't pay attention to these details but I just happen to because I've worked in the food industry before and I care about quality.

However the food was not really even what I would call good.  Bacon is bacon so it was good but the mac and cheese had limp/soft/mush noodles with what tasted like generic boxed cheese from a powder mix.   Def not even Kraft mix I like that stuff.  My hubby also had the bacon wrapped hot dog.  It was OK at best.  Not horrible just blah.  I shared his tator tots topped with mac/cheese topped with bacon.  The tots were ok just tots.  The bacon was just tiny crumbles and again see above for the nasty mac/cheese desc.  I also ordered the bacon chocolate chip cookies.  I expected bacon bits mixed in chocolate chip cookies at least that had dough prepared by them.  What it turned out to be was what is obviously a refrigerated cookie dough with a little bacon bits plopped on top then baked.  At $3 for two small cookies they could have spung for at least some Nestle cookie dough.  It was kind of generic tasting as well.

Wmo9uCoEcjnYBZovOpdGvw,UN6MXJuhyGcX7LTj4-b7FA,9c7MUiE6VI8NesjPdj5FkA,1.0,7,4,2,"My friend Kingsley was convinced that Philly Chinatown was THE place to be on Christmas day, even though I kept reminding him this is not New York. No matter-K. has a mind of his own, so after doing my other familial and social rounds on 12/25, the afternoon found me wandering rather aimlessly around Race, Arch, 9th and 10th Streets as Kingsley studiously consulted his phone in order to find places that were open. 

We supped modestly at a few hole in the wall stand bys that probably never close but he still was in need of more dopamine and ethanol refreshment so he told me cocktails at Bubblefish would be just the ticket. While I'd never been to the place before, I also didn't think it had a bar or any cocktails, speciality or otherwise, and told him so. He gave me The Look and said he'd call lest I waste my time and wear out precious shoe leather just walking over to see if that was the case. The phone rang and rang-maybe 20 rings-before it was picked up. My friend was told the restaurant was open and he asked if they served cocktails. The party on the other end seemed flummoxed as to the definition of 'cocktails' so Kingsley changed the query to, ""Do you serve booze?"" and was met with the equivalent of 'huh?!"" He looked at me for help and I suggested asking if there was a liquor license and did they serve alcohol. That got a resounding yes, so he grabbed my scarf and pulled me along with a vengeance to 9th and Arch.

The place was reasonably populated but even though there were a good number of seats in the front of the house, we were shown to a way too big for two banquette over by the toilets. As we were led to the seats of shame, I noticed no bar or bottles anywhere. Not good. 

We were given a menu-a food menu-and left to peruse and decide. Since we had been eating lightly but steadily for a few hours, we felt a drink or two would suffice along with 2 or 3 small plates of something. We choose chicken skewers, beef skewers, shrimp tempura and takoyaki. There was no drink menu so when our server re-appeared to take our order, K. asked for the drinks menu. The young woman pointed out the many iterations of bubble tea, citing a few of her favorites. Kingsley was having none of it and said he wanted a glass of wine or beer. The woman looked offended and said there was no beer and wine was only sold in bottles. We opted for a pot of hot tea and I had to put up with my friend's angry bitching until our food arrived. 

The shrimp tempura promised 3 shrimp in the menu. We were served only 2 along with a pile of tasteless, greasy vegetables. The frying oil was not hot enough so each piece of tempura was enrobed in a limp, oil sopping coat of breading. Some pieces were unidentifiable-lotus root? Potato? Mushroom? The shrimp tasted frozen and old. Both kinds of skewers came with no sauce or seasoning, just protein on a stick, and over cooked at that. We tried to get the server's attention several times to cancel the takoyaki since we did not want to stay or eat anything else. She ignored us and then sat down to take a break. I suggested we go to the cashier and ask to skip the takoyaki since we had now been waiting far too long but Kingsley wanted to be miserable so he sat and complained that I was a horse's ass to choose this place. I was just getting up to go to the front and ask to pay for the meal when the takoyaki showed up. Kingsley said we had waited far too long for it, we had finished all the other food and wanted it taken off the bill.  The young server seemed upset, apologized and said she would package it up to go. At that point, I just wanted to get out of the restaurant and my (ahem) friend's company and go home to some spiked eggnog, Madonna singing ""Santa Baby"" and a few Dave Koz tunes. We paid. We left. 

Bubblefish may very well be good for sushi; I'll never know. I do know that they don't serve cocktails, they don't have a bar and their tempura game is way way off.

I really wanted to like it but each time, my hopes were cruelly dashed.  I'm not going to talk about the sides because, as any bbq lover will tell you, it's all about the meat.  Real bbq is moist, succulent and bursting with flavor.  Sauce is optional and merely enhances the taste of the meat.  Preparing smoked meat properly takes a long time, hence the high prices.  Unfortunately, at Brushfire, it's not worth it.  Every time I ate there, I marveled at their ability to produce flavorless meat.  I tried all of their meats on numerous occasions but it was always the same.  Even the ribs have no flavor.  Last night I gave them one more chance but nothing has changed.  

If you've only ever had bbq at Brushfire or similar places, you really have no idea what you're missing.  Whether it's pork, ribs, brisket, chicken or turkey you want, go to a real bbq place, tell them to leave off the sauce, and see what smoked meat should taste like.  Fortunately, we have a few good options here in Tucson.  If you catch them on a good night, Catalina BBQ at Starr Pass is the best in town.

PROS:
- Brand new facility that's clean and attractively decorated.
- Proximity to the riverfront and restaurants and attractions like the children's museum.
- Two nice employees whose names I didn't catch: one woman at reception and one waiter.
- The maids did a fine job on the rooms.
- It has a pool and gym, though I did not have a chance to visit them.

CONS: 
Oh boy. The TLDR version is that this sparkling new facility is terribly mismanaged and needs to close, overhaul its management and operations, and ONLY THEN reopen. Details of some (not all) of the mishaps we experienced:

Restaurant: We ate on-site a lot because we have a baby and it was simplest. The menu had nice, healthy options, but our orders were often mixed up or had errors--e.g., the granola with a side of yogurt came out without the damn granola. Our group got their dishes at very different times, and sometimes the waitstaff had a really hard time telling whose was whose. Amateur hour in the restaurant, except for the one waiter I mentioned above. And oh yeah, the food is PRICEY and meagerly portioned. Don't go there unless you need to.

Service and site mishaps--the ones I can remember, at least:
- As other Yelpers mention, yes, that Heavenly Shower is heavenly if you enjoy sadistic ice bath rituals. It takes several minutes to warm up. What a waste of water.
- You're nickeled and dimed to death: internet access is $12.95/day; if you want a quick cup of coffee from the self-serve station, it'll cost ya $2.50 (and there may not be any coffee or cream left, as happened with me).
- I dropped off an important piece of laundry (my baby's sleep sack, which he had puked on) a little past the cutoff time but was told I could get it that afternoon. I was relieved until I was told that actually, I'd miss the cutoff deadline and would have to pick it up the next day. Until the NEXT day, I was informed that there was no laundry service on Sunday (my checkout day). So I used a towel as a blanket for the baby and traveled home with a pukey sleep sack.
- A maid knocked on our door early one morning. She was under the impression that we were checking out and wanted to get in there early. A) That wasn't our checkout date and B) Don't bug me before the official checkout time when I have a do not disturb sign on my door!!!
- This is minor, but no reading lights--so if one person has a light on, the whole room is lit up--not great when one person wants to sleep.
- Mushy ""fancy"" white tea soap that disintegrated in an instant, clogging up the drains with little white fatty chunks.
- The guest book boasts a huge number of items you can borrow while on-site, including even a high chair and stroller. I was SO excited because our stroller loan was late in coming through. But did the Westin actually have a loaner? Of course not.
- My TV broke and didn't work for two days, despite the efforts of the ""TV IT guy.""
- One of the two elevators was broken for over 24 hours, causing pileups.
- I tried to order a lunch dish from the all-day dining menu Sunday at around 1 pm. The person who took the order tried to get me to order breakfast, because they serve it until 3 pm on Sundays. I said no, I'd actually like the item from the ALL-DAY DINING MENU and she said she'd have to check whether it was available. She put me on hold for ages and finally ascertained that it was.
- The absolute coup de grace came at checkout on Sunday. Normal checkout time is 3 pm on Sundays. We asked for a 3:30 checkout because our baby was sick and napping in the room before our long redeye flight. Our request was declined, after we'd spent so much money and put up with all the rest of the crap.

I'll stop now, because this is getting ludicrous, but bottom line is that I don't blame the staffers so much as bad management. Something is seriously wrong here.",2014-06-17 03:40:30

My wife and I weren't super hungry so the fact they basically get irritated when you don't order all you can eat. Constantly trying to talk you into why it's such a great deal we only wanted 1 roll each and an appetizer. So here we go....ordered the calamari appetizer and 2 rolls. Well the calamari came out with the food so not much of an appetizer and came out super quick so made me think is this all pre made.? Every last bite of this tasted like it. The calamari was inedible tasted like rubber. The rolls didn't even finish had a weird not fresh taste and decided the risk wasn't worth the reward of getting some food in my stomach.

The bell is supposed to represent liberty and freedom and all that is great about our nation.  But it sits inside a bland glass room, surrounded by security guards (in the aftermath of an attack on the bell by a Christian fundamentalist who banged it with a hammer a few years ago while screaming ""God lives!!""--probably the most interesting story there is to tell about it).  

To see the bell, you pass through security, then an endless hallway of exhibits and information, making the bell itself seem comically insignificant.  You're expecting an interesting narrative about why it's cracked or its role in the revolution, but there is none.  The Liberty Bell is famous for being famous. It is the Paris Hilton of American historical artifacts.

Why must this bell be THE symbol of our city?  Philadelphia is REALLY awesome with lots to see and do.  But so many visitors get a photo of themselves with the Liberty Bell, eat a cheesesteak, run up the Art Museum steps like Rocky and then leave.  They figure they've ""done"" Philly because that's all we're famous for.  (The new city logo even features the Liberty Bell....geez!)

My beef is with the concept, not the location. (The service was quick and courteous.) The place caters to groups. It's strongly advertised as a place for multiple types of parties and the food is family style served in one of two sizes. The smaller ""feeds 2-3"". The problem with a couple is that you are paying for servings you may not eat. If the prices were cheaper then I could justify the waste. 

We had started with their $10.95 caesar salad. It  was the mediocre salad you would expect. I wouldn't have raised an eyebrow if it cost half that price. I cat help but feel ripped off at $11 for a few people.

We also had the baked rigatoni for $16.95. I think this price is very fair for even two people. (It could have served four.) It had dollops of ricotta which I enjoyed but only one slice/pile of mozzarella in the middle. The menu says ""lots of mozzarella."" The cheese is what I looked for in a ""baked"" dish. The sliced sausage was boring and oddly paired with a meat sauce. I see that it lists the meat sauce on the menu but I must have missed it.

Different waitress, and this time it seemed like everything went wrong. The hostess didn't make eye contact or say hello or anything.

At first I thought she left to go get a manager for us to talk to but, no, no one came to follow up or ask how things were. When the bill came, she had taken the guacamole off the bill so that was nice but all I really wanted was five dollars worth of guacamole and not the attitude.

I'm from the south and am used to exceptional customer service where waitstaff would never dream of being so rude to customers. That s*** really wouldn't fly here. We tip good and we expect goodness in return.",2018-07-27 01:23:23
Rtanlg84iCKolvNemSoWkw,oM1e8Nl9F0ajMJMW5f3abw,2OXCAbz3x_MrQSYj1zarIA,1.0,0,0,0,I frequent Pinewood Social because of its proximity to my place of work but they have played me for the last time. Today I ordered a $14 grain bowl to go for lunch and this is what I received. The food was stale - especially the poached egg which tasted like it was poached days ago and had been sitting out. The portion size is absolutely ridiculous for the price. I've never had a good experience dining in or taking out and Pinewood continues to do well because it's marketed to weekend tourist.

cScyi9ht0Ydq6Dgqx-Rqaw,nRYtnRFSbfQFbCwyWgSoqg,4yKBQiY6KCJmZVMSES77Kg,1.0,2,0,0,"I'm new to the area and decide to have breakfast by the beach.  I notice the sign out front for a $3.99 breakfast, sweet!  I walk in and the waitress, Dee, says I can sit anywhere, so I walk over to the table I wish to sit and she yells from across the restaurant, ""Not there!""  That's annoying, don't say sit anywhere when you don't mean anywhere. Her tone was rude and it was embarrassing, thank goodness the place wasn't busy or I would have walked out.

Dee suggests eggs Benedict and it being my all time favorite, I agree.  I asked if instead of the English muffin and hash browns I could have extra meat.  She said no and that she would have to charge me for the extra meat.  Fine. Now I'm annoyed.  She was so curt, it was a turn off.  I've been a server and you never say, no, you make other suggestions.  

Now the eggs Benedict, it arrives and it is not much, if any, presentation.  The Hollandaise sauce is all over the plate and it is very thick.  It tasted like it had flour in it which Hollandaise sauce should not have.  Instead of Canadian bacon they use an apple flavored ham.  The pieces of ham were huge, ridiculously huge.  Why didn't Dee tell me the pieces were big that ordering extra meat was unnecessary?  So of course, the extra meat I paid $3.50 was wasted.  The ham tasted awful, I don't know what it is but it was flavorless.  I did not finish my meal which is unusual especially for my all time favorite dish, eggs Benedict.  When the check came the dish was $9.99 + $3.50 for the extra meat.  $13.49 for a dish that I did not like; that's very disappointing. 

The coffee was mediocre and the ambiance was blah, nothing special. But I wasn't expecting it to be much.  The restaurant was not busy, in fact, it was  myself and another group at the other side of the restaurant.  So the restaurant was fairly quiet with the exception of the wait staff talking among themselves.  They were discussing leaving early and Dee became annoyed with the other waitress because she did not want to leave early since she did not work the day before.  The conversation was pretty loud and extremely unprofessional.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  

The following day, much earlier than the day before, my husband wants breakfast and wants to try the place.  I tell him I was not impressed with this place. We arrive and opt to sit outside, I did not want to listen to the waitstaff again. The tables out front are all wet.  We stood there for a few minutes and then  I walked in to get something to dry the seats with and lo and behold the waitstaff and kitchen staff are standing in a huddle chatting.  Finally, a waitress (not Dee) asks if we need someone to dry the tables.  Seriously?  If I were the manager I would make sure those seats were dried first thing in the morning so that your guests can seat comfortably.  It's Florida for Pete's sake and there is one thing you can count on and it's the morning dew, dry it!  

 The $3.99 is basically for eggs and toast.  We ordered an egg and 3 pieces of bacon for each of us.  Our waitress (a very slender woman) was courteous and kept my hubby's tea full so that was very nice. But neither of us was impressed and we won't be back.",2013-09-06 01:20:10

It's well decorated, urban chic, different than the usual blinding brightly rainbow colored places. I was surprised at the play equipment. It was a little dull. My 20month old daughter wasn't too thrilled with the selection. There were so few actual toys to play with. They need to add more variety and just more in quantity so that kids aren't having to wait or fight over toys. The little library area is super cute and well stocked though. There is a special place for crawlers which all moms super appreciate. (I uploaded a bunch of photos)

The biggest deterrent however is the price. You have to pay a cover?? $8 just to get in?! That's more expensive than monkey joes or bounce U or any of the other places where my kids could have WAY more fun.  $8 really??! That's just for one kid! If you have multiple kids its WAY too expensive to come for an hour or two, and you wouldn't be able to stay longer because there isn't enough to do to keep them busy for longer than that. Who can afford those prices?? Seriously. 

Then on top of that to make it worse, no outside food or drink. I understand it's a business and they need to make money, except my toddler isn't going to eat anything they sell. Toddlers are picky eaters. So not being able to bring her a snack was super frustrating. I bought a cup of coffee there. $3.50 for a plain black coffee. WTF?! That's worse than Starbucks. Yes it is bottomless but who drinks THAT much coffee when you're only there for an hour before your kid starts screaming because they're hungry or bored?!

I really really want to like this place. It's such a great concept. I want to go back frequently but I just can't pay those outrageous prices. . They just need to figure out prices if they want customers coming back. 

My suggestions:
1. Lower the dumb cover charge. $2 per kid. That way moms can afford the expensive food they offer. This price would make moms want to come back often. 
Or
2. Allow moms to bring in their own food and drinks in order to make the cover charge worth it. 

Either way, I won't be going back until they figure it out.",2015-02-11 10:14:50

We have been huge fans of Jason's for well over a decade ever sInce we lived in Beaumont, TX where we used to visit the location on Dowlen Road. We loved supporting a company with grass roots in a small town that flourished into a great company.  The service at this particular location has been on a downward spiral for several months and there were things that happened during our last visit that pushed us over the edge to the point where we won't return. Our party of 3 visited at 7 p.m. for dinner; the restaurant had about 4 other groups seated in the dining room who were already eating.  There were several dirty tables that were not bused and the dining room needed a little tlc. After placing our order I went to the salad bar to get some complimentary muffins (which are awesome), but there were no small plate on the salad bar.  I asked an employee if plates were available, the employee snidely pointed to the salad bar and said, ""they are over there"".  I stated they were out and she walked away with attitude into the back to get some.  We ended up waiting for 20 minutes for our meal which consisted of 3 sandwiches and 2 cups of soup.  The person who brought us our food was less than courteous and could care less about any form of customer service. I know people can have a bad day, but this was the second employee we had that cared less about customer experience.  Our food has usually been on point, but not this visit.  Our sandwiches were not up to par with the general high-quality we were used to receiving at this location.  For example, a Mediterranean wrap was devoid of hummus.  Our 2 cups of soup  were cold on top and blazing hot in the middle (obviously because they were microwaved).  This was especially disappointing because a cup of gumbo (a staple in SE Texas) cost $4.19 at Jason's.  As a customer, I expect better than this, especially for the price!  Sadly, the most off-putting thing I observed while I was eating was the line cooks.  We were seated next to the salad bar and had  a clear shot of the food prep area.  The employees were obviously working on getting the store ready to close as the line cooks were cleaning when not prepping food.  I observed  2 line cooks wiping the exterior of items behind the counter (inside and outside of microwave ovens).  They were using a bucket of water (and presumably a cleaning solution) and towels to clean; both employees were wearing gloves.  In between cleaning and prepping orders for other customers I never saw them change gloves before handling food; this went on for our entire visit.  So, because of poor customer service, poor food quality and horrible food handling practices we will not return to this location.",2020-01-21 20:24:29

The nigiri(red snapper, scallop and one other I can't remember) was AWFUL!!!! Stringy and hard to chew when it should be like biting through butter and flavorful, not foul. I couldn't believe they served us such an embarrassing excuse for fresh fish.

Next came the rolls. Again, inedible and a complete waste. We had an eel roll and, again, something so unmemorable I can't even remember. I guess Bushi is under new management so they offered 10% off, but we had to ASK for it, even though the sign clearly states 10% off. They seriously brought us our tab and when we asked why we didn't receive the discount, we were told ""because you have to ask for it.""

The service was claustrophobic. There is a BIG difference between being attentive and being overbearing. We received the latter. Whilst attempting to have a very serious conversation, the hubby and I were constantly bombarded by the hovering hen matron. Sweet but annoying.

I was not knocked down by smoke like a lot of people noted, but yes, there is an air about the place that is a light combination of smoke and old people. 

My friends and I headed to the rush rewards area (why rush? Sugar rush?) to pick up our cards. No lines, just a mishmash of people standing in a clog around three customer service jockeys. Invest in a velvet rope or duct tape a damn line on the ground, sheesh.

Yes, the casino is small, but I remember thinking the Borg was small compared to the casinos in Vegas I was used to. I do miss the fact there are no decent progressive machines, no wheel of fortune and stuff, as the highest progressive slot I saw was just over $1000, pretty much the jackpot on any 25 cent machine. Zzzzz.

I don't like the fact the dealers have their shirts untucked. One of my friends said its a nod to a more casual atmosphere. Frankly I'm tired of seeing people out in pajamas, sweatpants, and housecoats. If you're working the floor of a casino where I'm going to lose my shirt, the least you can due is tuck yours in. 

On to the refinery, the restaurant at the back of the casino. My guests and I ended up here as it has great views of the river. Some of those views are of the now decrepit dock behind the casino, which is a shame. Set that up as a lounge area and serve cocktails and grill some food out there and you's have a great space for people to relax, dance, whatever. There is a small, small area open when the temps are above 65 degrees, but c'mon, do some landscaping and open that back area up. Heck Cavanaugh's does a better job.

So the drinks were few and far between, and mixed drinks were worthless. Stick to bottled beers and expect no more than one freebie every 20-30 minutes. The food is bar fare, deep fried and greasy. I think  the healthiest thing on the menu is the pretzel but the sauces it comes with help fix that. 

The bathrooms were usable, but the automated hand driers were filthy (see pics). Seriously, how does a touch-less hand drier get so nasty? The location does little for the place either, as you can see from some of the pics I took you kind of feel you are in the middle of some busted old business park. I know the AC casinos are in the same type of venue, but hey at least the block your street level view of the decrepitude. 

What does this place need? Stop with the cheap ass Gordon Ramsey cookware and start with a better offering of food. Why no Tony Luke's? That dude even sells his stuff frozen you think he'd be happy to get in here! How about a decent VIP area? An upscale seafood restaurant? You're right on the river it would be perfect? Too pricey? What about a Famous Dave's and a Red Lobster - that would provide 'decent' food and still be in your target niche market.

I'll give up on decent drinks and stick with beer. Supposedly I get my $100 back to play another day in credits, so we'll see how things shape up on visit #2.",2013-01-22 16:54:54

I had the $8.99 shish tawook lunch platter and chose rice and french fries for my sides. There were 5 small chunks of dried up chicken.

Then they lost the entire other half of our order, not just the one shirt, and would contact us when they found it.  After several more days we were never contacted and had to ask them to look for the shirts again which were finally found but the one shirt was ruined.

We weren't even upset at the ruined clothing but I was annoyed at being told inaccurate information, promised a resolution, and not being contacted.

Throughout this process I went into the store four separate times.  Each time there were long lines because so many other clients were complaining about clothes that weren't clean, missing items, and delays.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad couple of weeks for this location or if they weren't prepared for the amount of customers they were able to attract.",2016-04-21 00:48:18

The environment was loud with a lot of sketchy people coming in and out all the time. It was dirty. The hallways and the elevators either reeked of weed or rotting trash. I was told that there would be trash pick up daily. Speaking of the elevators... Most of the time they did not even work. And when they did, their certification and inspection was expired for most of my time living there. We were lucky if we got it 4 days a week. Being that I lived on the top floor, we had a lot of issues with a leak in the ceiling. It took me the whole first year of my two years there for them to get someone to come out and fix it. This caused our apartment to smell like mildew for a while. It took a lot of air fresheners and products to mask that. The room itself is not terrible. It's not great either. The pressure in the shower is next to none. It took forever to get the soap out of my hair. Parking is a nightmare. Being that I worked closing shifts at my job, I would have to park on the other side of the complex when I got home. With not feeling safe, I was always worried about the walk up to my apartment. The kitchen was falling apart. When moving in (Aug 2018), we had placed some work orders because the cabinets were falling apart and the vents in the kitchen. The washer and dryer screamed every time they were used. No matter how well I cleaned the lint trap, my clothes would look atrocious. It got to the point where I'd rather go home to wash. The complex says that all utilities are included. This is true to a point. We were nickel and dimed. Every time maintenance would come in, our thermostat was lowered and all the lights were left on. This was frustrating to me because we were so careful about those things. They never completed those. To be honest, this apartment is not worth how expensive it is.

What not to order:
App: Calamari. It says it comes with tempura peppers & onions. Those are just fillers to your ""tempura"" calamari and your calamari is just a breaded crumble mess. We couldn't find any whole rings, just half rings of calamari & absolutely no tentacles. Mostly, tempura onion & pepper strips. 
I ordered the ""lump"" (pay attention here) crab meat stuffed grouper. I asked is the crab really ""lump?"" Our server said that it was lump but they shredded it. If I wasn't so set on having that, I should've known better. You never shred lump crab meat! The shredded crab was fishy tasting & grouper was dried out. I took one bite & asked for it to be taken away & luckily we were compensated for it. 
My partner got a filet (under seasoned) with one small roasted onion & 50/50 potatoes. The 50/50 mashed were really good. As they say, they're 50 part potato & 50 part butter & cream. What could be wrong with that? Lol. They were seasoned well & quite creamy.

The booth smelled like it was ""cleaned"" with a dirty smelly rag. 

We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come to our table.  Since the restaurant   wasn't crowded I feel we should have have been acknowledged quicker.

They weren't crowded as we were there at 3:30 in the afternoon.  She also gave me a hard time when I said I don't like using the pay at the table machine.  She actually told me they get in trouble if they have to ring up too many at the register.  Even if this is true it's not something to pass to a customer.

It's been two years now since I became meat free and I go there hoping for more options...but I've yet to see it. I walked in today (less than an hour ago) and there were 2 customers in this location and the lady behind the counter didn't bother to look up and greet me as I would think you would when someone comes into your business......yet the lady that walked in behind me got the most joyous and warm welcome anyone could expect. This immediately turned me off from wanting to eat there. It's sad ! I have been a customer since this place opened and have known many of the employees and managers personally.

Pros: the showroom is beautiful and clean. Cons: They're shady liars! TLDR: They add $1200+ of fees that they don't disclose until after you've wasted your time going there. 

I found what appeared to be a used Mercedes CLS63 at a fantastic price on truecar. I requested to make sure the price was accurate and that they weren't going to try and add a bunch of arbitrary, profit padding fees to the deal. Truecar showed only a $500 doc fee (which is also an arbitrary profit padding fee, but I digress). I called the dealer and spoke with Brynn, informed her I found the Mercedes on truecar and wanted to confirm nothing was added to the car. She confirmed the price and said only doc fee added. I drove 2 hours from Mesa to Tucson to discover that this allegedly clean car was not only filthy but smelled like cigarette smoke and had multiple flaws (power trunk broken, headrest switch broken, suspension switch broken, rear console lid broken). Despite these things, I really enjoyed driving the car so I decided to move forward with trying to purchase it. Long story short, they refused to honor the Truecar price and added over of useless garbage to it that I didn't want. They first tried to lie and say the add-ons were included in the price, then said they were included in the out the door price, but nowhere were these things broken down. After I questioned them, they then produced a hand written breakdown of $400 for nitrogen tire package, $599 flashing tail light and $189 for vin etching. I insisted they honor the truecar price or I wasn't interested in buying their car. The manager tried to make me feel guilty for wasting their time (uhm i drove 2hrs down and 2hrs back just to walk away empty handed but okay). They then said ""have a nice day"" and walked off. I understand that dealers have to make money and this is how they add to their profit margins, but I don't believe in it and won't do business with dealers who operate on this business model. Even after using what I thought was a trusted resource and DIRECTLY ASKING, I was lied to up until the point they thought I wouldn't say no.

First of all, when they called and said they were on their way, I didn't know that meant they were an hour out.

I would like to note that I did the moving myself regarding bins, small furniture, etc. the week leading up to the move.  I only hired a company to get the few pieces of big furniture (bed, couch, etc.) from my one-bedroom apartment into another one-bedroom apartment 4.3 miles away.  I never imagined it would take more than an hour and a half.  But I was wrong.

When they showed up to my apartment complex, they completely disregarded the gate-entry directions I'd given them (twice), so we had to get that sorted out.

The loading went smoothly enough, if not quickly.  The problem came upon arrival to my new place.  I had paid for two workers but essentially had one, because one guy sat in my room, scratching up my floor for an hour and a half trying to figure out how to put my bed back together.  The other guy moved the remaining furniture in on his own, which of course took twice as long.  I had to go onto the truck and get my clothes that had somehow fallen out of my dresser onto the truck floor.  The company said I could leave clothes in the dresser, but I'm sorry I did.

I finally stopped paying after two and a half hours, but they continued to put my bed together for another thirty minutes, meaning it took TWO HOURS to put the bed together.  My bed is pretty standard, and for someone who knows what he's doing, it would take about 20 minutes to reassemble.

Now I'm waiting to hear from costumer service about damage done to other furniture.  Like I said, I only needed a couple large pieces moved 4.3 miles.  It took three hours; there were two damaged pieces of furniture, and scratches on other furniture as well as all over the floors.

When trying to reset the day I was told that Monday was available (the day that I originally wanted but was told it wasn't available due to their lack of staff.) I ended up having to choose that day because all of their other options were weeks away. Then I had to go through the trouble of requesting a different day off of work. 

     No olive branch was extended to us for the mess up. It took three follow up calls before a staff member even said the words ""we apologize for the inconvenience"". Even so, there were no extra efforts to try and get our original date and time back and no offer of anything for our inconvenience. They truly didn't care. All that mattered was that their schedule looked the way they intended it to.

That was all before even stepping into the spa. After arriving I decided to put the scheduling issues behind me. The ladies locker room was tiny. Only two bathrooms and one shower. So you must wait to use the bathroom or shower if they are occupied. The shower was infested with really tiny black shower worms called drainfly larvae worms. It was disgusting. I didn't use the pool but the hot tub was overly chlorinated. Even after I showered and mosturized my skin was super dry and I smelled like chlorine for 2 days. It was so potent someone commented on me smelling like chlorine. My friend had the same problem but her case was even worse seeing that she had no time to shower afterwards. My skin is still recovering. The hot tub area was infested with ants too. They crawled all over our towels and belonging while we were in the hot tub. 

     The fact the the lounge is right out side of the service rooms is very unfortunate. I could hear people chatting and laughing during my service. I tried to be quiet with my girls since I knew we could possibly be a disturbance but that kind of defeated the purpose of a girls spa day. It would make much better sense to have the waiting area across from the gym on the other side. They were also doing some cosmetic changes to the spa the day we were there. They were hanging artwork in the halls. It was a bit of a mess and loud. Not sure why They didn't opt to complete the job before the spa opened or after it closed that day. Nails were being hammered into the walls while patrons were receiving their services. It was even disturbing to those who weren't receiving services. Customers were complaining in the waiting area about the noise. 

     This is not a ideal spa for a big group. We only had 3 girls in our group and our services were lined one behind the other so we didn't have much time to catch up with each other or talk. It was ""hi and bye"" between services. We had to go out to dinner afterwards to chat. I asked if things could be scheduled better for us and the staff said it was nothing they could do. I was left for a over a hour and a half to my own devices while my friend recived her service. One friend left because the gap in her services was so big. Another ended up purchasing a mani pedi out of sheer boredom. They don't have enough staff or rooms to properly accommodate a large party. We only had 3 people in our group, our first service started at 10am and the last didn't end until after 5pm...

They pre cut the steak which made for an extremely dry piece of meat. No flavor to the steak whatsoever. I managed to choke down some of it by eating the tomatoes with it to give some sort of flavor and juiciness. After the meal, no birthday dessert or even a remote mention of happy birthday.

The bike is for touring (it was used),we purchased extra warranty for that & found out LATER it could only be used at their location, also paid for the new license plus the next yrs. only to find out it was registered for the first yr.- again had to call them on that, which we were reimbursed. One good thing- they did give us some free apparel. Be sure to get EVERYTHING printed out- it was something we failed to follow up on especially if you buy a warranty thru them. We will never recommend them- would be embarrassed if this would happened to them. We went to Sierra Vista for our business and they treated us entirely different- professional, honest, great service, even a waiting room with free beverages- it's  worth the drive.",2015-07-22 21:33:29

I asked for onions on my Breakfast Jack and she asked if I wanted them grilled. I said sure and we went and sat down. After about ten minutes of waiting for our food, I walked back to the counter and nobody would look at me. I had to ask ""Is it ready yet?"" and someone said, ""yeah, almost"". No sorry, no nothing. I figured maybe the grilled onions were taking awhile. It finally came out and I opened my 5 year old son's sandwich and it was cold to the touch. I asked if they could microwave it for a second to warm it back up. So they went to the kitchen came back and handed me the sandwich. They must have put it in a nuclear reactor back there. I could barely hold it it was so hot. We ended up leaving and letting him eat it in the car later when it had finally cooled down. And the grilled onions? Not on my sandwich.

I have been going there because the service is fast, the price was cheap and there really were no issues. So then when my F150 needed it's $600 A/C repair, took it there, opened the credit card and got my air fixed. Well. Today I took my Journey in for its regular oil change. They said it would be about $45. Now, being that my husband works long and crazy hours, I take the cars for their oil changes. This time he came with me. He signed for the oil change, assuming the discount was applied at check out. When he told me while waiting I said I will talk with them to get the regular price. I went to pay and the manager JEREMY who must be the ""new management"" because it was always Mike before and we never had an issue. Well JEREMY told me that ""under new management"" the oil has to be the ""vehicle specification"" and not what the customer wants and the deal is for 5w30 and they needed to use 5w20 for my car. WELL JEREMY I have ALWAYS done CONVENTIONAL oil over synthetic REGARDLESS of where I've taken it. I explained to him that nobody said there was a change and if I wanted to pay that much for my oil change I'd have gone to the Jiffy Lube two streets down, not driven 20 minutes out of my way. Jeremy did not care. So we went to leave and I looked at the sign. There is NOTHING that says the deal is for 5w30. It doesn't specify anything about type of oil. Just says $14.99 oil change and tire rotation. So I tell my husband to turn around and I go back in to tell Jeremy this. He then tells me the sign says it's for conventional oil. NO JEREMY. THE SIGN DOESNT SAY THAT. He then just kept going on about how my husband signed the stupid little paper and he explained it to him. NO JEREMY YOU DID NOT. DONT TALK TO ME LIKE IM STUPID JEREMY I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE. I told him, you have our history right there, you would think you'd at least mention the change.

There were 2 instances when I had to speak to the nurse manager on duty because my mother in law was having an asthma attack. There wasn't a nebulizer on the unit and it took over 30 minutes to get an oxygen tank. Meanwhile one nurse berated me saying my mother-in-law just coughs a lot. 

Another time my mother in law asked for water and they refused because she was on an order for thickened water and they had none on the unit. They instead gave her thickened juice which she did not want. If you have orders for a patient to be on a particular product, it seems that you should have those items stocked. The nurse manager on duty seemed genuinely concerned that the staff did not care about her request. 

There also seems to be a lack of engagement, lack of daily activities for their patients. 

Additionally, we haven't been able to have skype calls since they locked down shortly after March 8th. They said they tried calling but we never had a missed call from them and phone records can verify this. Also, we were notified that she caught Covid because her roommate had it. Luckily, she survived but communication was very poor to the family members during this ordeal and we're still not able to see her. She has dementia and it hurts my heart that she probably does not understand why we can't see her. 

Its shameful that this organization cares more about profits than patients. Elderly and rehabilitative clients deserve trusted, quality care and sadly, I no longer have confidence in this organization to deliver on their mission.

The Appetizers: We gave the pickled vegetables a shot. We weren't impressed; they were very sour and hardly seasoned. The batch that night was in need of some sugar to balance the sour taste. 
The Main Course: I ordered the Korean Wraps, she ordered the tacos. The Korean wraps were very runny. They were prepared in lettuce wraps and laid out on a cheese tray so they were dripping all over the place. I probably drained about 5 ounces of liquid from those bad boys. 
The tacos wandered too far from traditional mexican look and taste; they consequentially took on a lack-luster look and taste. They featured sliced sausage, shredded iceberg lettuce, simple flour tortillas, meh salsa, with pickled jalapenos and shredded carrots on top of the tacos, (which unfortunately made the tortillas soggy on the outside). They didn't feature nearly as much avocado as the menu's description inadvertently suggested.  

It didn't help that their vegan proteins were obviously imitation fare-- they maintained the engineered form of the fake meat. Most vegan restaurants that immediately make an impression are the ones that fool even the carnivore; you'd never see small cubes of sauce-coated chewy bites, it just doesn't look good to me.

Overall the cost was about $40 for 3 tacos, 3 lettuce wraps, and some pickled veggies. I'd take 4 Chipotle burritos in taste and quantity over that a thousand times over.

I called 15 min to close to see if they could handle a bra fitting in a short amount of time. They said to come. I was right around the corner. Took me about 60 seconds to get there.  

1. The lady measured me and gave me a bra with the same exact band size as my exact band measurement she just took (40) which was too tight as it was exact on the largest hook. Oh well. Then she wanted to give me a 46! I said I didn't think 6 inches would be necessary. So she gave me a 44. Too big.  Then a 42 and just as I thought it was perfect. I don't know how this logic was lost on her.  But not a big deal. Then...

2. At 5:57 a lady came back and said in a rude (you're a nuisance) tone ""she (the lady I was working with) has to leave because she has to go pick up her kids.""  I said ""I can go if I'm causing a problem but I didn't think you were closed yet.""  I showed her my watch that said 5:57. ""And I called and you said to come anyway.""  (Why the tone and why make me feel like I'm in the way when you're not even closed yet?)

3.  I quickly changed, politely hung up the 4-5 bras in the dressing room and then walked briskly to the front. I stopped and said (in a frustrated but intentionally not disrespectful tone) ""I don't want to be disrespectful but the way you spoke to me made me not want to come back here. Why was it necessary to talk to me that way with that tone? To tell me that she had to pick up her kids?""  

You know what she said in an even more disrespectful tone: ""She HAD to go pick up her kids."" I said, ""she had to leave before her shift is over?"" and pointed to the store clock on the wall behind the register that still read before 6 o'clock (5:59).  She said again with much defensiveness, ""she had to pick up her kids! She lives 30 min away!!So I said ""so why did I need to know that?"" And she said ""I was telling you why I was taking over for her."" And I replied ""And why did you need to say it in that way- like I'm in the way before you even close?"" She continued with her defensiveness.  And shrugged. 

4.  So I said ""you just lost a purchase because of the way you talked to me."" (Their bras are $70!)

SHE SHRUGGED AND HAS TURNED AWAY FROM ME AT THIS POINT. 

""And I will never come back to this store because of the way I've been treated.""

SHE SHRUGGED AGAIN. 

""Are you the store owner?""

""No I'm not""

I just shook my head and left. 


So Ann,
1. Why do you hire women who think a snug bra needs 6 inches of room? 

But more importantly...
2. Are you okay with how your other employee lost you my business without even trying to handle this in a calm, non-defensive way after already speaking disrespectfully to me, making me feel like I've overstayed my welcome before the store closes, and then shrugged (instead of trying to work things out with me) when I said she'd cost you my business.  If one of your bras costs $70 and I would need 5, she just cost you $350 (not that I would have bought today because I only had 15 min). And not only that, but she cost you any future business (from me for when these bras would have worn out). And not only that, but also any business you would have gotten from me telling my friends to go to your store. And not only that, but any business you would have gotten from people reading this post who will think twice about your store and decide to avoid your ""customer service"" and disrespectful employee (very large white woman with very long wavy brown hair).",2016-06-08 23:47:22

But here is what I got for a 2-night weekend stay when Opryland Hotel was booked up. I paid $149 per night for a room with two queen beds, which was $349 total after Nashville added 3 taxes to it. My room smelled like a smoker's car, even though a funny sign right outside my door said this is a smoke-free hotel! Everything else was clean, except the staff forgot to wipe down the nightstand. It had a sticky ring of coffee or something on it. There is no room safe, no fridge, no microwave. 

Bed was comfortable. Pillows were OK, but too soft for my liking. Shower had hot water. Room was on corner of ground floor, but still it was quiet.Parking was plentiful, right out the side door. I used the exercise facility the first AM. Bunch of dumbbells and a bench. Two treadmills and an elliptical. I used one of the treadmills, which seemed fairly new and worked well. It had a TV monitor 1-1/2 feet in front of you, so I watched TV. They had an indoor pool that I checked out but never used. It felt to be about 80 degrees F, and the pool and whole area looked clean. 

I was told the hotel was 0.8 miles to Opryland Hotel (I was here for NWTF Convention). By using MapMyRun, I got exactly 1.0 mile walking from Fairfield to Opryland Cascades entrance. They have a free shuttle service that will take you to the Delta Convention entrance of Opryland, if you're willing to wait on it. It comes at the bottom of every hour, but only if you request it. Don't request it at the front desk, and it won't show up. Ditto for showing at the Delta entrance. There are about 4 or 5 hotels closer to McGavock Pike that I passed on my walk to Opryland, some with better ratings on Yelp. I spoke with a few people who were staying at Guest House, and they said it's dated, but otherwise fine, and it's cheap - under $100 per night.

Complementary breakfast at Fairfield was decent, but nothing to write home about. Scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs (cold!), pork sausage, mixed fruit, oatmeal, several cereals and breads. Orange juice and apple juice. 

I wouldn't stay here again, mainly because of the smoky room smell. Will try Guest House or Hyatt possibly. Incidentally, I've stayed at Opryland Hotel several times, and yet it only gets a 3.0 Yelp rating. I know it's expensive, but I'd rate Opryland a 4 or 5.",2015-02-15 14:14:47
Cbj4Yhg2b3G3jUrUS9jhTg,pkRI-nA3Vz0OdsyCKbWd2g,tWggqsQosvl26ZGX20CWPQ,2.0,3,0,1,"I want to like Kildare's.
 
I really do.
 
I dig the vibe - a raucous Irish pub where you can scream with laughter, tell tall tales and as the night progresses and the whiskey in your glass diminishes, singing loudly and off-key.
 
However, the food brings the party to a screeching halt. 
 
I know the old jokes about Irish cuisine -- potatoes plus meat boiled in a pot for nine hours, but this stereotype isn't true and Irish cuisine can be good -- fresh and flavorful.
 
Unfortunately, Kildare's doesn't aspire to these heights and the food remains middlingly mediocre.
 
I've been several times and been duly unimpressed during every visit.
 
The food isn't bad, per say. It's just not good. 
 
The Irish are famed for their hospitality and every Irish-themed joint I've visited showcases this by bringing out a steaming basket of soda bread. 
 
Every Irish joint except for Kildare's. 
 
Warm soda bread is one of life's little pleasures and ridiculously cheap to make. Kildare's needs to get down on this. It would be good oigedchaire (yes, I Googled the Celtic word for 'hospitality.' I figure it's apropos for a place whose bar is actually made in Ireland). 
 
While I give them credit for featuring a veggie burger that isn't a Boca Burger or Morningstar Farms patty, it's not a particularly good veggie burger. 
 
Frozen mixed veggies (the school cafeteria blend of carrots, corn, peas and lima beans) blended together and smashed on a grill. Served on an onion roll with lettuce, tomato, a plasma-like substance that I assume is American cheese and chopped-up pickle chunks (chunks? Really?) -- it's a bit of a letdown.
 
However, the fries were good for a processed product - crunchy, steaming hot and salty. If there's a better potato product than the french fry, I haven't heard of it. 
 
The vegetable boxty is decent - roasted vegetables served in a potato pancake, but I don't understand the decision to serve this dish with Provolone cheese. Ireland makes phenomenally good cheddar cheese. Why not include it in a typically Celtic dish?
 
Speaking of cheese, the macaroni and cheese is a terrible side - bland and stodgy with no hint of sharpness, mustard or buttery, bubbly crispy topping.
 
However, the one thing Kildare's does right (besides the ambiance) - it's the condiments. 
 
The chipotle mayo is smoky, spicy and actually tastes like smoked jalapenos, their whiskey mustard has an incredible depth of flavor that pairs really well with both the soft pretzels and beer and their Jameson barbecue sauce is a condiment that should be bottled and featured on every table in the place. 
 
If you're looking to knock back a couple in a rowdy, warm atmosphere that 
resembles the Ireland of the average American's imagination, Kildare's is a great spot.

However, if you're looking for Celtic cuisine to warm your heart and belly while stoking memories of the old country? Skip it and head elsewhere. 
 
Considering the history of Philly, a place with decent Irish cuisine shouldn't be that hard to find.",2012-01-06 22:27:33

-Three of us ate. The bartender put the orders in together and they came out so far apart that my friend was done with his salad before I even got my food. Even the bartender couldn't explain it, especially since it wasn't busy at all (just a few people at the bar).
-My food was burned. I ordered the grilled brie, and some of the crustini was so burned I physically could not eat it.
-While the bartender was great, the rest of the servers just stood around giving us the stink-eye.

I was gunning for the concept: fresh, locally sourced meats and produce, a creative menu, a 22 year old owner (no need to speculate on just HOW he arrived at entrepreneurial-ship....he is there working!). Many different starch options for the base of your stir fry are offered including rice noodles and quinoa. I opted for the quinoa, with shrimp add broccoli, in the tropicali sauce, and crispy garlic to finish. Your dish arrives in a chinese take out box.
Firstly, I hate eating out of those boxes. The food never really cools down enough to eat, and i had to dig through mounds of quinoa to get to my 4 shrimp and 4 pieces of broccoli. 
Secondly, after paying for our meal, the man behind the counter handed me the receipt and said a bowl of miso was free next visit. Great! Except when we left, the sign outside the door said, ""free bowl of miso with your wok!"" so really, he should have offered me the free bowl with the meal I just bought. Unfortunate.
The real problem here though is the Taste of the food. All I can surmise is that they don't properly clean the woks. There was a pervasive burnt taste that overpowered the added sauce. It was...gross. I was so hungry I still ate half of it, and smiled sweetly at the fresh-faced owner because I couldn't bear to hurt his feelings and tell him the food sucked. I will say, my husband got a similar dish (with noodles Instead of quinoa), and he couldn't taste what I tasted. I had a bite of his and that same burnt essence was there too. Perhaps I'm more sensitive to it. But truly, if you're looking for this style of cuisine, go to Honeygrow. Unless they work out their kinks here.

Then we asked him do you have a bottle opener so he came and opened it and walked away to serve the other guests. Then we asked the female bartender may we have some glasses and she handed us some. I know we look young so he thought we weren't going to tip so he dismissed us but I have been serving and bartending for 10 years in downtown New Orleans. Never be rude to your customers. I would've tipped you %30 or up depending on how you treat me. I hope you see this a reconsider the way you treat people. It will definitely effect your money.,2018-01-15 03:35:26

1. BUGS! We found these little black bugs on our bed and on the floor. We looked it up and they were not bed bugs but looked more like baby beetles.

2. COVID protocols! We just got back from a weekend trip and were expecting the hotel to be following the safety measures listed on their website. We rarely saw team members wiping down slot machines or high touch areas. There were hand sanitizer stations available through out the casino/hotel but we were expecting to see them wipe down much more often. It was so crowded that they opened up all seats at their tables when they were supposed to keep some seats closed for social distancing. They even turned on some slot machines which were supposed to be off for social distancing as well.

Since the merger, the overall service of the establishment has suffered.  This visit I will describe is further proof of this.  
He was served a $4 cheesesteak that contained little to no meat.  He simply requested he be served another chessesteak.  Instead, he was served the same cheesesteak with additional meat on top.  (Anyone who has gone through servsafe and various other food safety courses should be aware that once a food item reaches the table and isn't eaten, it is discarded).  My father in law demanded to see the manager at this point where he told him he wanted a new cheesesteak.  The male manager on duty presented the steak and not only did he not apologize for the previous 2 cheesesteak mishaps, he told my father in law ""I hope this meets your satisfaction."".  There was nothing we could do as this manager was arrogant and unaware of what proper customer service should be. 
We won't be going back to this establishment.  The customer at this place isn't treated with the utmost respect that he/she deserves.  The merger has set the Irish Rover back and it was better off when it was the old Irish Rover.

I was drawn in by the affordability - $35 is super cheap for a wax.  For years, I put up with Emma's annoyed attitude - sorry if I, a paying customer, was interrupting her daily soap opera viewing.  It's not like she's at work to...well, work or anything.

Despite the fact that I would oftentimes leave with wax still in places where there shouldn't be wax, I sucked it up because of the price.  I always tried to go in at times when they wouldn't be busy, for fear they would be even less pleasant than usual.  I always hoped Natasha would be the one waxing me, as she is at least friendly and will make conversation with you (even if she's also speaking to her mother in the other room at the same time).

However, my last experience was the icing on the cake.  Emma told me to go wait in the back room.  So, I de-robed and was on the waxing table just waiting...and waiting.  Two (not one, but two) other customers accidentally came into the room and saw my everything.  Apparently, Emma forgot I was in there and was telling other customers to go into the room.  Now I'm not a shy girl at all, but come on...forgetting you have a client within a few minutes of speaking to them?!  Unacceptable.

On reviewing the menu, we were pleased to see that it was both affordable and had a nice range of delicious looking foods. With great anticipation, we went in.

That, clearly, was the first mistake.

After waiting some time, we placed our order - gumbo for my lady friend, a reuben for myself. Eagerly, we sat back and waited for our food to come.

And we waited. In a restaurant with 3-5 tables out of a slew filled, we waited. The sun rose higher, and we waited. Ents had a moot, and we still waited. I grew a full beard, and, still, we waited.

To be fair, it was about half an hour total. Still, for a full staff and virtually no patrons, this seemed a bit absurd. Then, as our order arrived, we understood, at last, the cruel joke we were the butt of.

I'm a large fellow. I enjoy food. I enjoy reubens. What I got was something more akin to a larval stage reuben. At some point, if allowed to thrive, it may have become something sizeable enough to be called a sandwich. As it was, the alleged sandwich was roughly 4""x5"", similar in proportion to Wonder Bread. To really add glamor to the experience, the good folk served it to me using the heel of the loaf. I, clearly, was in an ecstasy of fine dining.

The gumbo, while tasty, was also about 1-1.5 cups total volume. I say it was tasty, though, really, we're working on conjecture; I'm not sure that it was actually enough to coat all the regions of the tongue. Perhaps it was bitter. We'll never know.

I think, on reviewing our time at the Napoleon House, that several questions were raised as to how it remains in business, hasn't been burned down, and how the waiters survive on what must be quite meager tips. It did, however, clear up why Napoleon died in exile - better death alone than any real association with this atrocity in restaurant form.",2011-02-18 20:22:57

While Im standing there feeling like a criminal as others are returning their cars and looking at me I notice that not one of the other 3 cars there are being examined the way mine was.  I turned to the associate he left behind and asked her what the problem was.  She said the manager believes you were in an accident, the car has been repainted.  I respond to her by saying unless I own a chop shop in tampa there is no way I could have gotten in an accident and had the car repainted in four days. She agreed and said she mentioned that to him but he wanted to check.  About 20 mins later the manager comes back and simply says...okay your good, just like a warden telling a prisoner your free to leave.

If you need any type of Internet connection to do your work this is not the hotel for you.  Horrible connection and the front desk staff don't care. 

Shower water pressure is so weak you are better off showering in the sink. 

Rooms are adequate but depending on which room you get some have aged quite a bit. 

I'm guessing my Gold status has never mattered to these people.  I mention these issues every stay and get nothing in response. 

It really doesn't help that this hotel is located in an area where the casino is considered the entertainment.  If you want to order food for delivery please keep in mind that your options will be limited...unless you like a gas station Tim Hortons, Wendy's or Boston Pizza. 

I've stayed at many Four Points hotels and unfortunately this one ranks at the bottom. 

Hoping the hotel management reads this and responds before my next trip to Edmonton or it will be a new hotel for me.

I thought I would enjoy the sandwich more than a big puffy pastry, but I fear I made the wrong choice.

First, this famous muffeletta is basically an oily cold cut sandwich served on a lacklustre bun with a mildly interesting (and oily) pickle condiment. It's enormous, so if you happen to like it, you will probably be okay with ordering just the 1/2 sandwich.

But you could possibly forgive this if there was something about the experience that made you feel like you were sampling the magic of New Orleans. There's no magic to be found in the dingy environs of the Central Grocery Company and the gentleman who grabbed my sandwich off a pile behind him and tossed it on the counter at me certainly did nothing to add to the charm of the experience. I would have like to change my mind about it all then - since I had assumed that this famous sandwich would at least be made when I ordered it, rather than sitting on a counter waiting to be thrown in my direction. But I took it, because the demeanour of the server/cashier suggested that he had hostility that he wasn't shy about displaying and I wasn't up to dealing with it by myself in a foreign country.

As for the grocery store. If you really like that pickle condiment then you can get it there, even packaged for air travel. That's what is earning them one star. The rest of the selection is stuff that I can find in my grocery store at home, so if this is specialized content in New Orleans, I just feel sorry for local food enthusiasts.

Never again, and I will never recommend it.",2015-02-08 15:41:27

Not cool. So we parked elsewhere, walked in to find the dining room space inside and outside at least half empty. Sat down at an open table outside and was asked to get up by a server informing us there was a 40 minute wait. Okaaaay. Went to put our name on the list and was greeted by very young, unprofessional staff that basically told us they were understaffed on the floor and in the kitchen and after a 40 minute wait to sit, it would be at least another 40 minutes to get food because the kitchen was backed up.

However, the service is terrible. I've been to both locations and they do not understand customer service at all. I tried to order macarons one time, they said fine, which flavors would I like? I didn't know what flavors were available, so I asked them- there is no listing or menu anywhere. Then they tell me, but also mention that not all flavors are available at any given time. So we go through this long-winded ordeal of trying to find out what flavors will be available- then they take my name and number, said they will call me back. They never called me, so I guess that's an order that they will never get.

Then to follow up, I tried to order a cake from them- that was a fiasco- wasn't packaged properly, staff was rude.

The owner's attitude summed it up the best- he told me ""if you don't like it, then you don't have to take it, get out."" I don't care how much you may not like the customer, but you NEVER say that to someone. There is a much nicer way to say the same thing, obviously these people don't care.

If you are going to name your self after the plant that makes tequila the first thing you should know how to do is make a proper Margarita. Their list is crazy over ambitious and their classic is HORRIBLE. The problem, with the classic is, they skimp the tequila then they will cut an orange in half and mash it up with god knows what and then they will drop it rind in all in a tumbler and serve it to you; this might sound fun but it tastes like ass as bits of orange rind slip in your mouth. Their other drinks as previously stated is ambitious and an attempt to be creative some sound amazing some sound crazy the problem is that they are extremely inconsistent or flat out gross.

Upstairs is the best area but the problem is that you will likely get ignored by the wait staff or at least its gonna take a long time. 

The problem is the bar tenders plain and simple. Learn to make a proper drink and if you don't know what or how to make a drink requested don't just make something up and expect us to not notice. I asked for chocolate cake shots NOT four shots of baileys straight .... I can tell the difference, in fact anyone who knows what a chocolate cake shot is can tell the difference. 

Additionally, the drinks are pricey. I don't mind paying $9-$18 for a drink especially cocktails but they have to be good.

Improve the drinks and the bartenders and this would be a 3-4 star after work business crowd place easy because it again LOOKS CLASSY and nice but you are first and foremost a bar if you can't make any proper or good drinks and want to charge up scale prices you don't deserve stars.",2014-11-18 23:56:33

My boyfriend and I decided to eat here with his daughter because we tried it last time we were in town and it was amazing! This experience was SO FAR from amazing. We requested the balcony as it was a nice evening out. The door leading out to the balcony was shut with a chair propped up against it to keep it shut. We started to move the chair because the person downstairs told us to just go head and seat ourselves. The waiter for that area was putting some food down at a table and said ""wait for me please"" so we awkwardly stood there while he took his time talking with the table, walked over to another table, introduced himself to then and then finally opened the door to for us to find a table. Things went down hill from there. He was inattentive, and defensive throughout. It was like he was brand new to serving. Perhaps he was. Everything was done in this sort of slow, non methodical manner. I couldn't tell if he was a slow, unorganized person or just didn't really care. When it was time for the food to come.  He brought out the dishes one at a time. He brought the wrong food for my bf (which was prob not his fault unless he put it in wrong). We were annoyed but still not frustrated yet. What can you do? Right? Well the server was gone for like 5-10 min, brought out the second meal, said nothing about the meal that had to be remade and went back inside for another 15 min. He then came out and brought some garlic bread which we thought was nice and then walked away. When we looked at him he said ""I'm not being inattentive, or giving you bad service. I just have to keep the door shut so the heat doesn't get in."" We said ""that's fine, but where's the rest of our food?"" He got defensive and started talking about how he's so busy and the kitchen is working as fast as they can and the restaurant is busy for them. By the way, there were prob 5 tables sat in the entire restaurant. Our server only had 3. One 10 top and two 3 tops. As a former server I can say that that is very doable. Also why be a server at a place where 3 tables is busy? You wouldn't make any money! His excuses and immediate defensive tone sent us over the edge. He then said ""well you shot yourself in the foot for sitting in the balcony, cuz I have two tables in there."" EXCUSE ME?! You NEVER tell a customer that bad service is their fault. My bf ended up waiting like 30-40 min for his food. The rest of us were long finished with our meals. He brought us the ticket and we saw how he had one of the meals comped which it should have been. We also saw that he charged us for the garlic bread we did not ask for. Turns out it wasn't just a nice gesture. My bf went outside at this point because he was going to lose his mind. When I went to settle the bill, pointed out the charge for the garlic bread and he almost seemed like he hoped we wouldn't catch it as said ""oh we'll have to take that down to the manager, just a second"" after a long pause. I went down to wait for him with the manager. When the server asked her to remove the bread he said to her ""this table....yeah I'll tell you about it later and explain."" Again, I used to be a server. I know that this means he will make it seem like we were total assholes and nothing was his fault. So I called him out in front of his manager and quoted what he said about us sitting on the balcony. I am not one to stiff a server on a tip because I know how much it sucks but I could not tip someone who was rude, made excuses, and was inattentive. I could handle the food messing up and even see how the long wait wasn't his fault but the lack of communication around the food followed by getting defensive and rude when we asked were the food was, is not cool. I can't even with comment about how we shout ourselves in the foot for sitting on the balcony. We will never be going back there again which is a shame because their Alfredo is pretty good! If they want to keep their business, then they need to get some better servers. I haven't served for 10 years and I could have taken over his tables and mopped the floor with him, all while smiling the whole time. It's what you do when you're a server. If he has just said ""I'm so sorry about that. I'll get that to you as soon as possible."" We would have been fine. My bf even offered to just take the wrong meal but the server said no! He was like ""let me make sure this isn't supposed to go to someone else."" Okay, everyone knows that once you place a plate, you cannot serve to someone else!!!! He did send us with a complimentary chicken parm (the original dish he brought out that was wrong) which was totally the same dish! Total nightmare. I can't even write about it an organized manner.

I went against my better judgement and started shopping at this Whole Foods location again. And I actually liked it. Until this past Monday afternoon. Now there's nothing left to like anymore. I had another bad experience at ""Hole"" Foods bakery department that went unresolved again. For starters, I stood at the end of a checkout counter like a fool in the rain waiting for someone to track down a manager (at WF's they're titled team leaders). When the team leader finally appeared 10 minutes later, Yibby listened to my story and immediately took the baker's side. It didn't matter to Yibby that I drove 20 miles out of my way to pick up some cranberry walnut rolls that were un-proofed.  Yibby suggested that I return tomorrow on my own time and on my own dime and purchase new rolls that will be corrected and perfected for my enjoyment. Honestly!  As for today, sorry about your inconvenience, says Yibby, and even though the displayed product (cranberry walnut rolls) was not up to WF's exacting standards, we're not about to award you with a $5.00 Gift Card to make up for any mistake on our part or possible inconvenience. Apology not accepted!  If the rolls weren't offered for purchase (they shouldn't have been) I wouldn't be standing here arguing relentlessly over inferior bakery products. What's sad is that I still went ahead and purchased perishable items (produce) at the store after my losing ordeal with the team leader.

I grabbed my bag of tangerines, went out to my car and called Customer Service (mind you- for only the second time in 3 years) to voice my immediate displeasure. To make matters worse; even though the customer service representative (Jay) seemed somewhat concerned about the doughy rolls - it's Friday evening and I haven't heard a peep. Nothing!

Hubby and I decided to splurge and book ourselves a junior suite with an ""ocean view"" (something we never do) and have a mini ""babymoon"". We got a good rate on the room because it was for a sun. night, plus AAA discount, but this room is usually over $500 a night, so we had high expectations. Very disappointed. No ocean view (we booked through their website that gave a choice of ocean view or garden view, I paid the extra charge for ocean view) however, the staff was really nice and took $20 off my bill for that. The room looked dated, nothing special, had funky greenish hued fluorescent lights, broken appliances in the bathroom, and my biggest complaint - no water pressure in the shower!! The shower looked awesome with body jets and a big shower head, so I got excited, then got in and body jets didnt spray at all and head had no pressure. I can't believe they have the nerve to charge so much for that room.  The halls were dirty, threre were broken glasses in the hallway throughout our entire stay,  like literally, the same broken and dirty glasses remained in the hallway as I watched the staff walk by them. We ordered food down by the pool, took 45 min to get a salad (it wasn't busy down there) and the waitress dropped it, the dressing spilled all over the ground, she didn't even clean it, my husband got up and cleaned it because kids were running through it then getting into the pool. All and all, NOT a luxury resort, or whatever they call themselves.  We will definitely not be staying there again, very disappointing for a rare splurge :(",2014-06-11 13:32:30

After driving by and seeing the outside which looks appealing, I was surprised that the place was dead empty on a busy lunch hour.  Empty.
The owner / worker were a bit overly excited to greet me, which tells me they are hurting here.
Then I look through the very limited (for a sammich shop) menu, and am surprised that everything sounded really good.

I ordered the Mikey, which is what I would call a $7 canned cranberry sauce cheap bread and even cheaper turkey... just gross.
We also got a Italian whaver-they-call-it.  
The bread looks an awfully like the cheap hostess hoagies, and after eating it I was shocked.
If they handed this to a real italian, he would spit it on the floor.
The olive dressing was bad, the meat cheap, and just overall left a bad taste in my mouth.

Ambiance was cool in an old building. Out hip bearded waiter was nonchalant.

Or waiter forgot about us for more than 20 minutes which I would think would be hard to do in a small bistro. I ordered the smoked pork belly which was tasty but presented in 4 very thin slices as if it were lox along side a modest serving of creamer potatoes for $25. Portions were more akin to a tasting menu then a legit entree. 

$17 for a simple Bourbon cocktail was pricier than at the gorgeously chic Sezerac bar at the historic Roosevelt Hotel.

My wife and I determined it was best to cut our losses and to retreat to somewhere else for dessert and a nightcap. When the waiter presented the dessert list we politely asked for the check and he responded with visible displeasure? The food is only part of the experience dining out, I suppose the aloof waiter tainted it for us.

Our experience at Coquette was that of a hip bistro that has aspirations well beyond their ability to execute in both the food and the service-definitely not Chez Panisse! By comparison we also tried John Besh's Luke and absolutely loved the food and the pleasant service.

I believe you have to try a place more than once to give it a fair shake, but our stay in NO didn't allow for that.

Lower expectations and add another $ to the rating is my final thought.",2016-03-23 19:17:57

This place is absurd. I got two bites of pork belly, for 14.00 and although it was tender I failed to experience any real smokey amazing flavor. I tasted a slight woodsy flavor, but can't really say this is smoked as there was/is no deep pinkness to the meat or the smoked ring that accompanies real slow smoked pork. The bisquits were clearly not made fresh and the Usual buttery flavor was completely absent. The pickled onion served on the side was a mouth puckering unbearable dose of pure vinegar. My husband ordered sausage, which surprisingly had a decent flavor, but was obscenely over-cooked. The buffalo blue cheese fritters don't taste like anything other then freezer burn.

I called and made sure they had it in stock before borrowing a buddies truck and driving 55 miles one way to pick it up.  I got there and everything went pretty smoothe.  I gave them $1000.00 and went around to the back and picked up my sectional. 

I toted the sofa in the house and began cuttin off all the cardboard and plastic.  Instead of a two piece sectional, they gave me a regular sofa and half of the sectional.  I waited till they opened the next morning and called them to tell them I had received the wrong sofa.  One of the so called managers, TOM says, ""I'm sorry about that, just come back down and we will swap it out with the right one.""   I let Tom know that I had to borrow a truck from a friend and that I lived in Clarksville.  

He told me that it is their policy for me to bring the sofa back since I picked it up.  I explained to him that I paid $1000 dollars for something I didn't receive, and I should not be held liable for their mistake.  I told him I wanted them to pick up the sofa that was not mine and bring me the correct one.  I was put on hold for a few minutes and Tom said that he would make an exception this time and would have it delivered when the next shipment went to Clarksville.  I thought some common sense had taken place, until I asked him when it would arrive.  He said that he didn't have a clue, but it would be before three weeks!!!  Totally unacceptable.  My living room had everything pushed to one side ready to get the couch swap over with, so I ended up having to borrow a truck again, used two hours of leave from work($50), and spent $50 dollars in gas to correct their mistake. They blame simmons for marking the plastic wrong.  I even told them they should make the delivery and bill simmons then.  Tom assured me that it does not work that way, and was bold enough to compare his store to Walmart.  He said, ""If you go to walmart and buy dishes, then get home and the wrong dishes are inside, then you have to bring the dishes back and swap them out.""  WELL, Walmart doesn't say no returns and no refunds, so you are not like walmart, are ya?  I would of gotten my damn money back if that was the case!

The first plate I picked up in this like maybe 10-15 item ""buffet"" was covered in food underneath which immediately made me question the cleanliness but wasn't enough to deter me from trying the food. 

Moving into the actual buffet which actually had crock pots for several of the items was disappointment after disappointment. For the most part it was similar to what you would expect to find in a free buffet in a lower grade hotel and I've had better prepared eggs in a buffet line in some hotels. There were very few options and nothing stood out as overly amazing though I tried most of it. I did not try the monte cristo but the first trip through the buffet turned me off to the food enough to not have interest in going back. 

The only food highlight I encountered was the chai tea which as they described it was ""heavenly"". It was a leaf tea and combined with what was either fresh ground nutmeg or cinnamon topped with frothed milk. It was truly a great cup of chai and the main reason I may give this place another shot on a non-buffet day. They seemed to have a good selection of tea which was all loose and sitting there for just a cup of tea would probably be worth it as the outside is very pleasant. 

To sum this up this place does not have an impressive buffet so I can say for certain it gets an F for Saturday as it is your only option. The tea is at least an A- as it is excellent and uniquely presented but I can't say better than shangri la as their selection is not near the size. The people are very nice but sadly it does not make up for disappointing food and dirty plates. I did enjoy the atmosphere as it was unique and quiet outside. Sadly I go to a restaurant to eat and if the food is bad I just can't endorse it. Giving this place a shot on a regular food day may be worth it just because their tea is so good but buffet is really not anything you haven't encountered in a cheaper hotel and for 12-13$ not worth it at all.",2014-07-27 03:10:43

The food was nothing special. This is my second time there. First time I wasn't impress. The plate was huge but the food was scrapped into a little corner leaving an empty plain on the plate for you to wonder about, empty feeling in your stomach, and a empty hole in your wallet. For the price they are asking for, you can get way more food and better quality somewhere else. I ordered a beef hot pot and lamb hotpot. Setup was nice and all, but really I didn't come to admire their fancy China plates. I came for the food and that was not what I was given. The meat after cooked, shriveled up to the point it can fit a small teacup. Really? I paid $30 for a teacup of beef and lamb. They didn't even have their own signature hotpot sauce, you had to make your own from scratch. It's like me paying them to let me cook and season my own food. Why didn't I just go to the Asian market and get my own ingredients? I could had gotten 5 times the amount of food for a fraction of the price they just charged me. Plus I wouldn't have to deal with their poor service. 

Now the main reason I decided to give this place a try again was because I bought a Groupon for their business. It advertised ""$40 a value for four"" and no fine print anywhere. The instruction were simple. Come in, order, eat, use the Groupon, paid the extra, done. The only fine print they had was limit one per customer one per visit. But the services there had the balls to tell me, ""Oh I am sorry this one is only redeemable if you have four people."" I don't know where you think you are son, but this is America, where two can eat like four people. Spoke to the manager and he said the same thing. This place haven't been opened long, and I can tell from dining here it won't last long. Because the service here is terrible, the manager is terrible, and their practice is shady and dishonest. Don't be fooled by the high star rating. Most people are just bedazzled by their interior design. The food quality is really no where close to real Asian cuisine. 

All and all I won't ever return to this place again. And I would advise anyone using Groupon, not to purchase coupons for this shady business. $40 a value for four? Really? Each dishes average $20 and can feed half a person or one small child. Expect to spend $100 if you are going with 4 people. Where did they come up with the fact that 4 people can dine for $40 here?

I was put in a room that wasn't next to the elevators, but there was an intermittent/almost constant mechanical noise that I could not locate the source.  Maintenance was sent up and the guy told me it was probably the elevator mechanism on the roof (as I was on the top floor) so I requested another room.  They gave me a drink voucher for the troubles.

The second room was more or less the same, though the wall thermostat didn't work and you had to go directly to the unit along the outside wall.  They told me that most units don't have operating wall thermostats, but I wonder.  This room had stains on the couches, a half sucked peppermint on the floor, and the door would not even close properly unless force was used, and even then it barely worked.  They sent maintenance to correct this as well, but it seems like no matter how many times I would ask to change rooms they'd give me another crappy one.

I did let them know I was upset and asked for some sort of compensation.  They asked me what I wanted and I asked for (and received) a voucher for a meal in the restaurant downstairs.  Nobody was there to greet me in the restaurant, so I just requested my order to go at the bar and cashed in my vouchers.  Food was decent, but I'm sure I wouldn't pay whatever they were priced at.

I really enjoy Summerland's Grenache. I've actually purchased a few bottles of it, as well as, the Pinot and Chardonnay. 

However, my qualm with this business is the customer service. On several of our visits we waited 10 - 15 minutes between pours with empty glasses without a staff member once noticing or acknowledging that we were ready for our next pour. 

Moreover, when they do pour they are not knowledgeable, friendly or descriptive about what's being served. I imagine that they miss out on lots of opportunities to up sell or gain membership to the wine club by failing to engage with their clientele. 

My very first experience at Summerland Winery, months and months ago, they employed a gentleman from Los Angeles on Saturdays who was incredibly adept in wine and provided excellent descriptions of what was being poured. It's no coincidence that that was also the day that I walked away with six bottles and my friend purchased three. 

The younger staff, particularly the tall, sandy blond or light brown haired, gentlemen who works there is especially negligent of customers. Usually he stands around socializing with the staff, friends that have come in or just sort of staring off into oblivion. 

When you address him directly he is short and curt. His demeanor gives off a ""screw this job"" air, like he has a big middle finger glued on his forehead or a chip on his shoulder about working there.

However, I do remember one occasion where I observed a stark contrast in this staff member's behavior. When we first arrived he was his normal rude self, wandering from behind the counter, staring off into the ocean while a busy tasting room bustled with guests. Fifteen minutes later he was behind the counter, describing wines. Baffled I mentioned to him that he's never described the wine to me before, and he causally said with a smirk, ""the boss is here;"" and rolled his eyes. Cue, a gentleman whom I guess is the owner, walking in from back door. It's amazing what a little supervision does. From that moment on, all the staff were behind the counter, describing wine, filling glasses and engaging. What a concept! 

I suggest ownership heed my last recount and get some supervision or management in that tasting room when they cannot be present themselves. Hourly staff with no integrity, incentive or personal buy-in in your product's success cannot always be trusted without supervision to do the job the same way they would if you were present. It is a shame and that is not always the experience with quality employees but in this instance, this is a fact that has been observed first hand on more than one account, by more than one consumer.",2011-06-23 18:25:13

It's hard to describe exactly what was off, but there's just little intangibles that were missing that really made all the difference. For example when my steak arrived The plate was searing hot as usual. But the steak was cool to the touch. It's like they heated the plate well after the steak was done. Or the mashed potatoes with which I've come to associate with Rich cream, butter, and garlic were totally devoid of any of those flavors and textures. It tasted like instant potato flakes, A little bit gritty and flavorless. At the end of every Ruth's Chris meal, I always order a latte with berries and cream. The cream in this desert was almost like instant pudding. Overly sweet and little bit fake tasting.

My main complaint is about Plato's as a corporation and not necessarily this specific location, although they were not very impressive in terms of stock. Very old, wrinkly items hanging on overstuffed racks. Plato's really needs to adopt a more quality over quantity perspective. 

One thing I never understand with this company is what exactly it is they're buying and why. The clothes in there are pretty rough and basic, typically cheap material. I have no clue what compels them to accept the incredibly basic clothing and reject anything with a sliver of character or style that was made after 2015. 

Going through some other reviews here and seeing other clothing items rejected only supports this question I have. My main complain is that people drive all the way to this location, lug in bags of clothes and only have a couple things taken. What a shitty thing to put someone through for $10. I really wish Plato's locations would post online what clothing items they're looking for, what they're definitely not and what they maybe would take. It would cut down so much time. They are for sure scanning the clothes and an internal system tells them yes or no and if yes how much money to offer. So this all stems from the corporate level. 

I luckily only brought in one bag, which probably contained about 15 items. Only two were taken for a total of $7. The clothes were nice, some not even worn. I haven't even checked to see what they took but that's just how unimpressed I was with the whole business and what they do. 

Another thing, do not give your clothes up to be ""donated"" by them. Just do it yourself. God knows they probably just keep the clothes and save them to sell for when they actually need them.",2020-09-01 23:53:18

The food was -middle of the road ok. The reason I will not return is the service we received. This goes up in the Worst Service of my Life category. It was like I was in the twilight zone because everyone around us was being served in a timely manner. 
Lets start with our drink orders. My friend ordered a mai tai and was told no. Just like that...no. I ordered a gin press(1/2 soda,1/2 7-up) and it took a few minutes of going back and forth for the server to understand my apparent complex request. It came back wrong but I drank it anyway. Im not sure if there was any gin in it all. 

We ordered our complete meal(apps and entrees) when the drinks arrived.

The gyoza soup is made in a miso soup broth which is odd but some may like it that way-just not me.
So then the real problems started:

Soon after our orders were placed- 4 out of 5 soups came out-the missing one showed up about 10 min later. 
 20 minutes later, the rest of the apps came out. 
Then about 30 minutes later, 2 of the 5 entrees came out. 
 ONE HOUR LATER, the rest of our entrees came out. (simple entrees like fried rice and rolls)
We had empty drinks the whole time. No water refills. No apologies about the delays. Not a smile. Nada. 
Then we waited another 45 minutes for the check. By this time, it was after 9 pm and we were there for 3 hours!
I felt that they hated us for some unknown reason.

I don't mind paying more for food due to the Pandemic as the buffet prices did go up but don't gouge me an additional $2.59 for a beverage, that was always included in the buffet. 

On my visit, a recent Saturday night, which was suppose to be food from around that world was mostly the remnants from Friday nights seafood buffet.

The clams and mussels were combined and served in one large hotel pan.

I thought this was a bonus towards tonight's buffet, but the clams were mostly dried up or closed.

The mussels were ok, but not steaming hot.

The lobster ravioli was gummy and in limited quantities. 

The Turkey and the beef stew was just acceptable.

The ribs were tasteless, tired, and mostly fat.
I did try to revive them with barbecue sauce but it was not effective.

I tried some fried chicken which was lukewarm as it was piled high on the buffet. This was the only selection that was abundant.

The onion rings were somehow still hot and not soggy. This was the winner of the night but not worth the $17.99 buffet charge.

I heard another guest comment that the pizza was not on the buffet tonight.

Desserts were decent as I did get a piece of pumpkin pie.

Again, mostly everyone that I saw was drinking water from the tiny complimentary tiny water cup as like myself, I wasn't going to be "" fleeced"" with paying an additional $2.59 for a soda cup on top of the already increased buffet prices.

I will not be returning in the near future as I'll wait until they bring back the breakfast or Sunday brunch buffet.

I also noticed by the buffet registers, was a tip jar.

I was under their home warranty on a Kenmore refrigerator that I bought from Sears.  This refrigerator broke down.  I called their 800 number to have someone come out to repair it.  It has been over a month and we are still without a refrigerator.  They have a call center in the Philippines who make the appointments.  We were not able to get the first appointment until a week and half later.  When the technician finally arrived he said that he doesn't have the parts to do the repairs.  He charged me $79.00 for the diagnostic fee and ordered the special parts before leaving.  A second ""repair"" appointment was scheduled for another two weeks.  During that time only some of the parts were delivered.  

Apparently, Sears didn't deliver all the necessary parts.  So when the repair person came out a second time he still wasn't able to do the repair.  We are now re-ordereing the missing part and don't have any idea when it will be delivered.  The repair person said he will place the part on an ""emergency order"" (whatever that means).  When I try to contact their customer service department in the Philippines all they do is read a script.  They cant tell me when the part will be delivered or provide me with a tracking number or a contact person in their parts department so that I can get a status.    

We are now over a month without any results.  I've been on the phone and online trying to find someone who can address my specific concern without having a script read to me.  So far nothing.  

My recommendation is not to use this company.  Sears is highly inefficient in the way they do business.  This is a company that makes their customers do the leg work instead of having a system in place wherein there is clear collaboration between parts and service.  They also overbook their repair appointments to the point where their customers are not able to secure a new appointment until several weeks down the line.

Therefore, lets get this started. 

My family and I decided to go the Beechwood (aka City Bistro) for lunch on 7/14/16. As we approached the bar, there was an outside tall table within 5 feet of the door where two males were smoking cigarettes. This is not what I wanted to walk through with my infant son before entering the restaurant. As we entered the building, the music was so loud that my wife actually asked if we could leave because we couldn't even hear ourselves talk, but me being stubborn, I refused (biggest mistake) and explained that I really wanted to try the revamped restaurant that I had just seen on ""Bar Rescue"", so she gave in. The hostess/waitress/bartender (yes, they were doing it all) let us sit wherever we wanted, so I explained that I wanted the quietest place in the restaurant since we had a child, therefore we sat in the far corner of place. Now, it should have been another red flag that we were literally the only table sat in the entire place as everyone else (maybe 15 people) were surrounding the bar area, but once again, I was stubborn and chose to ignore it. When our waitress came to the table, we requested a child seat of some kind (some places have high-chairs, some have slings, etc), but were told they did not have any. How do you call yourself a restaurant and not have any means to accommodate young children? To make matters worse, the waitress basically insulted us and asked, ""Does the little one even sit up? I didn't think they even lifted their heads on their own until they were like 2 or something."" Not exactly the welcoming we were expecting. 

We both started off with waters as were looking over the menus. When the waitress returned, we ordered the soft pretzels appetizer and I order a Budweiser draft. My wife asked what kind of craft beers they had and clearly the waitress had no clue as the first three she named were ""Shocktop, Michelob Golden and Bud Light."" Then she said ""some kind of toasted lager"", but did not know the brand. Keep in mind this bar/restaurant only serves a dozen beers, so you would think the employees would know their products. My wife ended up with a 312 Urban Ale. The beers were fine, but the appetizer was another story. The pretzels were hard on the outside and cold gooey on the inside. The beer cheese that normally come with it was out of stock so they substituted a nacho style cheese, which was okay at best. Then came the meals. My wife order the sliders, which you can customize, and I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. Neither of us liked the food. They were very basic and lacked any true flavor. After the waitress set our food on the table, she did not return until the food was completely gone, which was a decent amount of time as my wife and I took turns eating because we were feeding our child his bottle at the same time. 

After the meal, the waitress came to the table and made a whimpering sound to my son, which my son did not react to. The waitress stated, ""Huh, my dogs always react to that sound when I do it. I wonder why he is not."" So now my son was compared to an animal. Then this waitress proceeded to be about as unprofessional as you can get as she crouched over forward, stuck her hands downward in a (bunny style) and began barking and jumping up and down, while staring at my son, trying to get a reaction. I about lost it. I immediately asked for the bill. 

The waitress did not return to the table while we backed up my sons belongings, therefore we had to go to the bar and flag her down (actually a bar patron did the physical waving her down because he saw my wife standing there hopeless and the waitress was playing on her phone, not paying attention to the patrons.) Now, I still tipped 20% because I understand they make a living off of that, but be mindful that I normally tip much higher. 

Needless to say, I will not return. I found this restaurant to be very unprofessional in every aspect, except the two male kitchen workers who spoke with us and were very nice and polite (they came out to get some water at the bar and saw my son). One of the men even stated he has never seen a child in there before. Now I know why. 

Finally, the women were dressed skimpy, in a dark colored lingerie. I was not aware of this before deciding to eat here, so families be warned. This rescued bar/restaurant needs to be rescued.",2016-07-29 10:53:35

This salon is tiny with too many stylists trying to fit clients into one space. My stylist, I believe her name was Sandra or something of the sort, was dressed unprofessionally and while she was doing my hair rather scatterbrained. I explained to her that I wanted a flip part and she agreed that she could do versatile. She was back and forth borrowing a comb from another stylist who was using the same comb in her client's hair at the time without the use of barbicide. When everything was done she was so proud of her work and encouraged me to look in the mirror. right away I noticed that not only was there not a flip part, but she created a part I could only wear to the left and it was created by two exposed tracks. Upon further inspection. there was a huge (and I mean huge) bump protruding out of the back of my head from where she braided my hair underneath. I could literally pull up the track and put my hand through some the part. I was terribly disappointed and then pissed when she charged me $200 and then immediately scooted out the door.

I wanted to get the sew-in redone with a different stylist however they never picked up their phone and from other reviews I surmised that the other stylist weren't all the better than my own. I had to pay someone else to take and re-do the atrocity on my head. She laughed and kept trying to figure out exactly what sandra was trying to achieve when she decided to do my sew-in.

If you want to wait over 45mins-hour(s) and still receive cold/old food this is the place to be! One time all I wanted was a large Sprite and medium fry. I waited a long time to get that and by the time I received it my fries were cold. I let them know my fries were cold and they took them back 15 more mins had passed and the worker came back with a bag I ate another fry to make sure it was right and do you know the girl gave me the same dag on bag of fries I just handed her 15 mins ago because the fries were still cold ..I had to argue to get my money back smh. I pass by one morning 12/2/21 and saw no one at the windows and decided to stop by thinking I would get through quick but upon entering the parking lot there was a long line of cars at a standstill.10 mins in and NOTHING I drove around to see someone at the money window just standing there talking on the phone then at the pick up window you see workers standing around talking and playing. At this point this place needs to shut down and be made into something else or someone else needs to take over and manage this place. I sometimes think to just walk in put on a headset on and start taking orders and cooking because the ppl they have are worthless and not good for nothing!",2021-12-04 16:04:21

Ordered rouge burger, truffle fries, and seasonal pumpkin gnocchi. The burger was cooked medium rare as requested but fell apart instantly as the buns absorbed the juice. The pattie  was really thick and juicy yet somehow the burger still ended up being dry.

Gnocchi was a small but heavy dish. Full of flavor but way too much flavor. Needed something simple and clean to pair with it. Has a hint of Asian cuisine flavors.

It was determined that our cat was suffering from a urinary tract infection.  He was given antibiotics to treat the infection in addition to anesthesia for the dental cleaning and some vaccines as well.  Over the next few days he stopped eating, stopped drinking, stopped going to the bathroom, and he just lied in the same spot and hardly got up to walk around.  We could tell something was wrong so we brought him back to the vet and they discovered he was suffering from renal failure.  The combination of drugs he was given all at once overloaded his renal system--which was already battling infection-- and caused his kidneys to fail.  We had to bring him in everyday for 4 days so he could be given intravenous fluids to reverse this effect.  Our total bill for these 4 days of treatment was just over $380.  If that weren't bad enough, on the third day when my wife picked him up he was covered in his own urine.  They made no effort to clean him up for pickup but rather ""sprayed some stuff on him.""

Not even the slightest gesture was made to say, ""hey, we kind of screwed up, sorry about that"", nope, just ""here's the bill.""

This place is often too loud and obnoxious unless you're here at a non-peak time. The chips are delightful however, and I did like the speed of orders being brought to the table at a non-peak time.

Second delivery was smooth as they were simply installing bed rails.  Third delivery they had yanked the sofa off of truck resting it for over an hour completely on the one arm (which subsequently FELL OFF 2 days later), brought the wrong entertainment stand and spent nearly 3 hours bringing in 3 pieces of furniture. Finally the fourth delivery team replaced the couch efficiently as well as the entertainment stand but left without leaving the appropriate shelves. Finally there were exposed staples which had poked my 16 month old daughter popping out of the loveseat. The 'repair technician' came out and put 2 new staples in the fabric to hold it in place.  The staples were barely attached to the wood of the frame and easily pulled right out.  I ended up getting my staple gun and repairing it much better than Bob's 'highly trained technician'. The furniture is made with subpar materials, the couch frames are nothing more than press board and very fragile.

The salsa is very different from what most people will expect in both looks and taste. It doesn't have the most appealing color to it but it wasn't bad. The chips had too much salt on them though.  We started with their queso dip because we always get it at any Mexican restaurant. It was beyond bad.  I don't know what recipe they are working from but I have never had a queso dip that featured onions in it. It seemed to have both regular and green onion in it and it was so overpowering you couldn't taste the cheese. There was so much onion and tomato that you were really left with very little cheese to eat.

Our daughter ordered the kids nachos and I can make better ones myself. It was nothing more than chips with melted cheese on them and by the time they got to our table the cheese had hardened and she had trouble getting the chips apart. Our daughter loves nachos and when she gave up just a few chips in I knew her dinner wasn't good.

I ordered a simple chicken quesadilla because my son usually shares with me. The chicken didn't have a very good flavor to it and the combination of cheeses that they used gave it all a weird taste. Not to mention my dinner was already lukewarm when I got it.  The rice isn't very good either and my understanding from friends is that this menu item is already different than the one they were serving when they first opened.

My husband ordered the enchiladas (one of each kind) and said there wasn't anything really great about any of them.

She said, ""do you want room for cream?"" I said, ""yes."" But, before I could finish she pointed me to the half n' half across the way. I don't drink cow so I waited...waited... While to baristas in front of me never responded. Meanwhile, another lady came up with her tea. The barista asked if she needed more water. I took my cup of coffee and huffed off. My boyfriend brought my cup back up and asked for soy which was given. That's great! Yet I can't understand why 10 minutes later he got his coconut chai that was Luke warm. Keep in mind you have to hear them scream the people's name for coffee. I saw a lot of people trying to study for school. It was annoying for me, I can't imagine.",2015-11-17 05:37:44

I was still hungry after spending $12 and i think the rest of us were all still hungry after a complete bill of $60 for 4 people. 
Waste of money and time, I needed to eat 45 minutes later. 
Don't bother...stay home, cook mr noodle and add some veggies and chicken and kick back in front of a movie for the night, its more cost effective and guaranteed tastes better.

He was so hard to understand (and my husband works with people in his company all over the world) that I had to end up taking the call.  He was asking some very personal questions, I did not thing was relevant to the insurance company purchasing a CPAP.  Then the next day we get an email from the Supervisor of Respiratory Therapy stating OOPS Sorry that call was a mistake.  Our physician sent in an order after his RT checked the equipment and found it to be defective and being 4 years 5 months old they sent an order to replace the machine.  They checked with my husbands insurance and found out that it can be replaced every 3 years.  However, the supervisor of billing knew better; and would not allow the purchase to continue as CPAP's are only replaced every 5 years.  Did she call my husbands UHC and verify his insurance and coverage NO!  She knows he insurance and its every 5 years.  SO I called UHC (United Healthcare) myself through his employer and verified with a representative in the DME department that yes his CPAP is covered every 3 years. SO I called the RT Supervisor back who had the Supervisor of Billing in her office at the same time, I told them that I had just spoke with UHC, who I spoke with and that Yes his policy allows for CPAP's to be replaced every 3 years, except in the event of abuse, neglect by the patient, or the CPAP is stolen.  None of these are the case.  This was on Monday by the way, because on Friday I had to go to their certified repair center in Indianapolis and have the machine evaluated, they found the main PCA board was going out, the blower motor was also going out, the lid to the water chamber was broken on one side and was not sealing properly, and the user interface knob was missing.  Then they added notes stating ""due to the Remstar PCA boards being on indefinite backorder, there is no time frame that this unit can be repaired.  This unit needs to be replaced.""

Now on Monday after I drover 45 minutes to and from the repair center Friday, the RT did not like this as the form they gave me was an itemization of all things wrong with the unit, and then the note at the end.  She said she wanted a letter from them, not this itemization.  I then told her that I was done arguing with her, with the insurance supervisor and all.  We had about $1300.00 left to meet our out of pocket deductible, and one Apria Direct the Philips Resprionics Dreamstation runs around $990.00.  I ask her directly is that the same price you have there in the building and she said yes they run right around $1000.00.  I said then since they are giving us such a run around on this that we will just purchase the machine directly out of pocket (we would have to anyway since his deductible has not been met) and file the itemized copy of the bill directly to the insurance company ourselves.  I said can you have the unit ready by 4pm?  this was 1:15 pm.  She said yes; and said to make sure he brings a credit card for payment, I told her he does not carry Monopoly money for such transactions, and he will have the Credit Card for payment.  So he gets there about 4pm, and they want to collect are you ready for this $5,000.00  yes I said FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.  That is a 500% mark-up.  He called me and ask me about this, and she the RT Supervisor claimed I am the one who set the price at less than a $1,000 and she never quoted me a price what so ever.  I told him to leave there, tell her to stick her 500% mark up machine where the sun done shine, and we will just order off line.  

 Not only did we call ApriaDirect.com and speak to a rep there, explained what we have been going through since July 26, 2018 and still no machine they gave us a 15% discount because of our troubles.  And we have a CPAP being processed as we speak.  Now why couldn't the local Indianapolis Store do that?  It is not that difficult, and when I was speaking with the Supervisor and RT and Billing I ask for the Store Manager she immediately said he's not available.  Then I ask for the assistant manager, she said that's me.  umm humm.  So what is the best way to get the message out...write a bad review.  And state exactly what happened from start to finish.  I'm going to finish with the doctor sending 2 prescriptions because the one to replace wasn't good enough they wanted one to repair also that was on 7-28-18, and then on 8-6-18 she wanted another script from the doctor requesting replacement of the CPAP that she already has on file.  Totally incompetent and she is a supervisor!  Supposed to be setting an example for the other staff.  
Now the bad thing is This is the best company we can go with, as the other companies available are even worse.  At lease with Apria's supply  center we get our supplies on a regular basis and on time.

Kevin was our sales rep and he was NOT pleasant. My brother was planning to trade in his car to put towards the new one. Kevin showed us the 2021 Aspec. Then we asked him to see if there was any TLX awd with tech package from 2018 on. He showed us one 2018. At first he keep pushing us towards the 2021 Aspec. I'm sorry but if we don't see options how do you know which one we want, correct? He seem very impatient towards us i guess because we look like kids. We would have paid the rest in one sitting after the trade in difference, but he seem to didn't want our business so we let him do his thing. After test driving the 2018, we came in to give him the keys. My brother liked it but wasn't thrill about the interior. We told him we didn't like the interior. There were none of the TLX awd with tech package available for test drive. Did i not say when we came back in he had start serving another client. Which was fine with us. We asked him what would be the value of the trade in for our car. He then got a little more impatient (i guess we were keeping him away from his ""better"" client whom came in after us). He literally belittled my brother by saying ""you have to find the car you like before go on with anything. I don't do business that way."" Wth! Seriously? The tone was just indescribable. I will NEVER forget the look and attitude. He said that right in front of the other client and made my brother and i feel like we were incapable to purchase the car and we are wasting his time. How many of you have come in and aim for one car and bought it right away? We are not buying an item from a grocery store! Unbelievable! What kind of business is he looking for? I have bought 2 not 1 but 2 brand new car from the same dealership and have NEVER had this kind of disrespectful service! My brother is a frontliner. He wanted to get this car because of the awd so he wouldn't get stuck in the snow going to work. This is ridiculous! Luckily my brother is an educated young man or else he would have let him hear it right then. I was ready to but my brother said ""no need we just take our business to someone who wants it."" There is no room in this world for this. I can see already that if you don't dress the part or look the part, then don't take your business to him!

I was with 2 other people - we stopped by for a drink and an appetizer. It said to seat yourself ... so we sat outside. There was only one table outside that didn't have leftover food all over it. Took forever for the waitress to come out and greet us. One person ordered a beer and the other two ordered waters. And I asked if she could please wipe off the table because it was sticky. I am not kidding when I say it took 20 MINUTES for her to bring out the beer. And I had to remind her two more times that the table needed to be wiped.

We ordered ONE appetizer - chips and dip. This also took an absurd amount of time, especially considering how simple of an appetizer it was. We then asked her to bring out some small plates and napkins (there was no silverware/napkins when we sat down or when she greeted us). She never came back out with these items. One person in our group spilled some of the dip on her and she had nothing to wipe it off with ....... honestly ridiculous. 

An all around AWFUL experience. It's not rocket science to serve ONE beer and ONE appetizer. What should have been enjoyable and quick turned into a 2 hour experience ....

And the other tables never got cleared. We drove by the restaurant a little later and all the tables were STILL covered in food!!!! That's disgusting.

We initially were trying to go to Chatterbox and sit outside, but it was too hot with the sun beating down on us so we finally made our way to Louie's Wine Dive, eager to sit inside.

I had my service dog, Quest, with me. Whenever I bring Quest into a restaurant or anywhere public, I always have his vest on that clearly identifies him as a service dog and have his gentle leader around his nose so that he's well behaved. We walked in and were greeted at the host stand, and they had to ""check"" to make sure we could sit inside. The restaurant was nearly empty so it wasn't like there was a question as to why they were ""checking"". They told us we could sit anywhere, and we chose a table by the window.

The menus are laminated, and there's nothing wrong with that. But my menu felt like it was dirty or had some type of residue on it. 

I eventually settled on their chicken tacos and a glass of a more full body red wine. The chicken tacos have a slight kick to it, but I don't mind that. I knew that Mass Ave isn't exactly going to be kind to the wallet and don't mind paying more for quality food. The wine was a nice, full body wine that you can take your time with.

Finally, as we were eating, they sat a rather large group behind us in a nearly empty restaurant. While normally this wouldn't be a problem, this did create several chances of him nearly getting his tail stepped on and I think this could've been avoided if the hosting staff paid attention to the scenario and sat the large group somewhere else.

The food and drink are not bad, but the atmosphere and hosting staff leave a lot to be desired. If you're wondering why this wine bar is nearly empty when other bars and restaurants are packed along Mass Ave, it is because of experiences like this.",2017-04-09 03:09:41

How did I know this? Because I have a special computer I carry around with my tools when I am making a long cross country trip.

Unfortunately the bank forgot I was driving through a few states and they locked up my account- no pleading over the phone would get them to loosen up the grips on my electronic plastic cash.

So here I am, limping like a three legged stray dog trapped in Santa Barbara and behind schedule.

Somehow this shop pops up in Google search and I decide to pay them a visit.

When I got into the shop they treated me like a typical ""female customer"" I could sense their greedy rat paws tremble at the possibility of getting a slice of cheese.

I walked in, flat out old them what was wrong and showed them my diagnosis. I explained I am factory certified and am on my way back home to accept a job offer from Audi and needed to high-tail out of town as soon as possible.

After this, their tune changed. They didn't give a rats rump as to how well I had diagnosed my vehicle and was going to buy parts from them anyway- this is where they deserve 0 stars:

As I mentioned earlier my bank card was tied up. I called my Fiance and told him what was going on. He gave me a card number over the phone with expiration date and the special code on the back.

I needed spark plugs and an ignition control module to be at 100%. 

This is where the rat turds show their true colours. I give them the info and say charge me the $250 so I can get home.

They REFUSED. I pleaded and they REFUSED again and again. I offered them my drivers license to keep which showed the address I was driving to, I offered to have my fiance call them and order the parts on the phone. Nope- no bueno, then they accused me of possible credit card fraud- yet my car was parked in their driveway with a roof rack, back seat and trunk full of boxes and luggage...along with out of state plates and DOD stickers.

I started to count my cash I had on me. All I had was enough to cover one part. I chose it by flipping a coin in the air and then walked out after they told me it would be a 6 hour wait since the parts were coming from Los Angeles.

Amazing they could do that but it took over a half an hour for chips and salsa.

Yelp is a damn liar. I trusted these reviews and got burned. The food we did see on our way out also looked very subpar. The tacos were small and just some meat thrown on a little tortilla. The burritos looked like the size of appetizers.

1) they are super weird and aggressive about payment. Once the doctor discussed the treatment plan with me, a man in a suit came into the exam room to explain the pricing to me. It just felt very ...invasive? Confrontational? They wouldn't do the treatment until I paid and I had to leave the exam room to do that. That's not usually how dental practices do things, you usually pay at the end for services performed. For some reason my insurance did not cover most of what they were doing so it was a big sum of money. 

2) The doctor and dental assistant seemed to be annoyed with me asking a lot of questions before and after my procedure. I left not really knowing what my full recovery time would look like, and just a sheet of paper with instructions that were not that helpful, especially because they were for wisdom tooth extraction which is not what I had done.

3) I am in a great deal of pain and don't feel like they warned me at all about what to expect. They said if I had the procedure done yesterday I'd be able to get on my flight the next day (work trip) but am in so much pain I had to postpone the flight. I might have decided on a different course of treatment had I understood how much pain and swelling I would have. This goes back to not taking the time to really explain the recovery process to me. Now I have to get on a flight tomorrow for a work trip and spend a conference looking like a chipmunk and slurring my words. 

4) This is supposed to be a 24 hour dentist. They have someone on call. I called around 8pm because I was in excruciating pain and wanted to know if that was normal. No one answered. I left a message. It's now 9am the next day.. the practice is now open, even and I haven't received a call back. Unacceptable. 

I haven't recovered yet from the procedure so I can't yet tell if they did a good job or if I'm going to have any complications. So, I'll update this review with that outcome.",2018-10-14 13:20:17

Since I live near Broad Ripple, I go to the area to eat quite frequently, and I have had a few dining experiences that just irk me because of the overpriced lackluster food, which I feel is IN THE NAME OF BROAD RIPPLE. Come on, don't take advantage of us like that: This is not what we're about.  With places like Three Sisters, Poccadio, Sinking Ship and countless other restaurants that actually offer creative, often local and fresh tasty eats at affordable prices, you have no excuse. 

I ordered the Eggplant Tower, which was pretty tasty (One of the only vegetarian entrées). Visualize: A gorgeous early evening as a couple casually sits outside on 54th and College Ave. enjoying the scenery and energy of the chaotic intersection as vintage bikes breeze by and an occasional rider leaves a lingering scent of patchouli in the air as they head home with fresh veggies filling their basket, locals walking their dogs, groups of patrons in casual, trendy summer attire across the street laughing and enjoying a pub's brew and food, the occasional skateboarder, and friendly passersby with dread locks and tats all adding to the wonderfully laidback and eclectic vibe of Broad Ripple and out walks my waiter with my $17 Leaning Tower of Pisa of veggies like I'm at the Ritz- Carlton  The portion size was almost that of an appetizer and for this price, come on.  Again, it was pretty good but not the freshest of veggies, and it had a moat of hard melted, crispy cheese around the base, which is not fresh. My partner had an angel hair pasta dish, and again, it was okay. The pasta leaned towards sticky, and though it did offer tasty bursts of sundried tomatoes, which appealed to the eyes and taste buds, the dish lacked in color in that it was only white and red: It was okay but bland.  For me, I appreciate it when the food is relevant and reflects the vibe and energy of its location, but the tower tried too hard and we know Broad Ripple isn't about that; so again, come on TJK, your performances are so on point, and I want to take you seriously, but please get your food and prices in line with your location.

The bartender continued to explain that she was staying over last call and closing time just for us, though it was only 12:15am and the closing time on their website lists 1:00 on Thursday. 

I will not return. Our waitress was great, but the bartender ruined this place for us. Just garbage.",2013-06-07 04:56:03

The lemonade line was ridiculously long and they have it set up on a hot black top. The lemonade was very good but I would NEVER wait in that line again.

03/28/21 We ordered:
oysters
Hush puppies
Cheese grits
Nola plate (sampler)
2 margaritas 

We were seated  upstairs. Once asked for our drink order we requested 2 fresh margaritas. I asked the server to have the bartender make it with fresh juice instead of a mixer, she wasn't sure if that was possible so she had him come over. I asked him if he could use fresh lime juice and fresh simple syrup... he said yes no problem. Then he sets my drink down and ask me to taste it to make sure it's good... I took one lil sip and realized that he had in fact still used the premixed margarita mix instead of the fresh ingredients. Clearly he couldn't make a. Simple margarita so We decided to Have  him to just replace the margaritas with Moscow mule since all it requires is ginger beer and vodka (can't really screw that up)
So he takes the margarita back and makes the Moscow mule. 
Then the server comes to take our food order as mentioned above we order a few things and await the delivery. 
It comes out and after tasting the first cup on my dish I realize it's like warm so I call the server over and tell her it's cold and that I didn't want that bowl. She offers something else amd I declined... I then tried the second and third bowl both were also like warm so I called the young lady back and tell her just to take it away! she offered to get me something else I declined and asked her just to take that away as well... 
I was  frankly pissed off that both the my drinks and food I ordered were all inedible. When she came back to check on us for the last time I handed her my card and asked her to just bring me the bill. This was done in my hate  in hopes that this would speed up the process so I could go get food elsewhere before it was too late. So she went and ran my card for what I thought would be an adjusted bill seeing as we sent pretty much everything back to the kitchen since it was freaking cold it simply grossed me out. 
Well when she dropped the bill off for me to sign I realized that not only was both nasty ass margaritas on the tab but so was every other item ordered! 
So I requested to speak to the manager.
what's going on, he says
I said, I sent back everything I ordered with the exception of my oysters. He didn't realize I had already paid the check at this point. He said well you ordered all of this right? I said, yes I but it was nasty so I sent it back. He said, you have to pay for it. I said, I already paid for it but once she brought me the receipt I realized there wasn't any adjustments and I think that's wrong and I need you to fix it. He said, I'll take 1 of the margaritas off since he only made one. I said but I sent the one he did make back. He said, well it cost money to make food and drinks And someone has to pay for it. It's not my fault you ordered it! You have to pay ! I said I've already paid, I just want to have it adjusted and you can rerun it for what I actually got. 
I continued to try and explain to him why I felt the check was unfair. He said , well you should've talked to me first because that's what I do, I fix problems"" 
Bahahaha Lmao... did I mention I WAS COMPLAINING TO HIM AT THAT POINT I MEAN HOLY CRAP, I WAS LITERALLY DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID I SHOULD DO BECAUSE he  "" fixes problems""
Then he reiterated that I needed to pay my bill. I told him again that I already paid the bill. 
SO NOT ONLY WAS I TALKING TO THE IDIOT BEHIND THAT VERY STATEMENT BUT HE WAS DOING NOTHING TO ""FIX  THE PROBLEM"" 
I mean shit dude, Where the hell was the fix to my problem???
So for one last ditch effort 
I ask again if he will rerun my credit card for the right amount, he then doubles down ans  tells me He is not going to rerun my card for an adjusted amount and I'm basically stuck with that charge because the company loses money when they make food and drinks for people regardless if they eat, drink or send it back
Ok, so don't forget guys, I already paid my bill,  I also made it clear to him I had paid the bill during that  lovely uneventful complaint and he either missed that part of the conversation or he didn't understand what I meant when I said I ALREADY PAID AND I JUST WANTED TO CANCEL THAT CHARGE AND ADJUST THE BILL FOR THE CORRECT ITEMS.",2021-03-30 02:49:56

I'm pretty sure every incompetent mechanic that works for them lacks the basic skills to diagnose an issue. Unless your car isn't under warranty and they get to make a profit, then they can find things that you didn't even realize were an issue. Purchased my vehicle here less than 4 months ago, it's a ""certified vehicle."" Certified means looked over and assessed prior to sale and the cost for a certified vehicle is usually a bit higher than a used vehicle. A certified car also comes with a 12 month bumper to bumper warranty that EVERYTHING is covered on. The tire pressure light was on in my ""certified"" vehicle when I test drove it. I brought it to the attention of the salesman. When I decided to purchase the car I was told the ""brand new"" tires were a little low from sitting, they put air in my tires and the light went off. I purchased my vehicle in the end of February. The beginning of April my vehicle was due for inspection, the tire pressure light was on again and brought to their attention. I was told the problem was rectified when I picked my car up from inspection. WRONG!! Less than 1 month later in May the tire pressure light came on again, back to the dealership we go. I was told the tires were fine and that there is no leak, they reset the light and I was on my way. Well surprise less than a month later here I sit in the month of June for the same tire pressure light. Now for the kicker, a lady who works in the service department told me it's the tire pressure sensor, it's not a big deal and it doesn't affect the performance of the vehicle. That it is  $225.00 to fix it. I told her it's actually free because I'm under warranty, she told me warranty's do not cover that issue and I told her my car was just purchased less than 4 months ago. Shocked by this and the loss of profit these crooks wouldn't make she ""looked"" into my warranty and to her surprise I was right. I wonder how many people they get over on that aren't aware of their warranty's. Her mistake was telling me that there was actually an issue before she looked to see that my car was covered. They seem to be pretty famous for just resetting issues and sending people on their way when it's a warranty.

Needless to say their ""certified"" vehicles clearly are not competently certified prior to being sold. I would avoid this dealership because they are dishonest when they state their vehicles are certified. And if you get sucked into the vortex and purchase a vehicle here avoid their service department. They clearly have no issues diagnosing problems when they make a profit on it!",2019-06-17 15:49:00

It sounded fantastic. However when we arrived someone had forgotten to put our booking in the calendar and so they were extremely understaffed. They did the best they could with the staff that they had, but they didn't give us a full pedicure they basically just painted our nails. Which also would have been fine until it came time to pay. We brought them 14 girls worth of business and they weren't able to give us any sort of deal. So they didn't give us full pedicures but charged us for the whole thing and then ""included the tip"" because there were so many of us but instead of having us tip $5 per person they had us tip $5 per service so we eached  were required to tip an additional $10 on top of paying for a full mani and pedi.

I went there and they come out with the original sales price AFTER I told them what I was looking for, the price and the payment amount.  I even showed them a quote for a step down vehicle from their own website.

For over 40 minutes, I ask them for my keys back.  They asked me if I was good on $24k and I said yes if they met my car payment terms. They didn't meet my offer and wanted to play this game of ""if you give us $5250 for a down payment we will be able to get you to $400 payment.""  They were trying to charge me $30k for the vehicle thinking I was stupid enough to fall for their numbers game.  Do you think I was born yesterday??? That wasn't the car payment I wanted and trust me, I don't have bad credit.   They were still trying to charge me the original price, the totals didn't add up PLUS still refused to give me back my keys. Also, they were charging more for tags and I know this as I was at the DMV the day before and they told me what it should be.  $89.00 to transfer.  (Sidenote: I am a diabetic and my blood sugar was dropping.  IF it would have dropped to much, which it was heading in that direction, they would have had a major lawsuit)!  

They continued to play games even when I told them that another dealership offered me the same vehicle (I called the Red Hoagland dealership while I waited for my keys) for $250 (23,750) less than what I was trying to work out with Brandon Hyundai.  (Out the door).  As I mentioned this to them, then they wanted to talk but still wanted money down to reach my payment.  I said no and to give me my keys. By now, I had decided to call the HCSO if they didn't bring my keys out as I was about to start bottoming out on my blood sugar.  I should file through the Attorney General's office based on my medical condition and age. 

Finally, the salesman did after the fifth time asking.  I even asked a lady at one point who sits there and walks around with promotional cards.  She pretended like she talked to them and said they were coming out with them in a minute.  I watched her the whole time and she didn't say a single word to them.  She walked back and walked around and then came back out to me.  

As I was starting to leave, another guy comes out.  I don't know who he was or where he came from but he wants me to stop my vehicle and talk about financing.  He even offers me the vehicle for $250 less (23,500) than what I was offered at the other dealership.  I told him NO!  I had enough of their games and was done!  I was willing to pay $250 more.

For a dealership to keep your keys after being asked one time is sad.  Two times is too many.  This shows who you are dealing with.

It started off bad from the beginning when we were seated and it took the waitress at least 10 minutes to come up to our table and take our drink order. Before she actually came up there were two other waiters hanging out at the hostess stand talking amongst each other as if they were trying to figure out if we were their table or not and never once did they come over to try and speak to us or figure out what was going on and if we still needed to be helped.

By the time the waitress came over to take our drink orders we already knew what we wanted to drink and eat so we made the order at that time. My wife ordered water and soda and I ordered a water. The soda was some kind of natural stuff that they make themselves and tasted like flat soda that you would buy at Kroger or Walmart, it was absolutely terrible!

We ordered the pump pizza which after eating it we would've much rather gotten something from a chain pizzeria because it was not worth the money nor our wait. When our food was brought out that was only the second time since the start of our visit that we saw our waitress, the other one was when she brought our drinks.

she did stop by our table once shortly after we started eating but that was it. Once we were finished eating we sat there again for at least 10 minutes with no sign of our waitress to clear our table and ask for our check. Our drinks had run dry we had nobody to ask for a refill from and I had to literally walk inside and tell the bartender we were ready to go and needed our check.

Five minutes later the waitress returned to our table with the check we paid and walked out. This is the first and last time we will visit here. We plan on checking out other restaurants within the village but will never return to this place. Sadly it wasn't even late at night on a Saturday it was just around 8 PM and the place was not even busy as they were open tables and the bar was dead.",2014-08-13 00:07:21

I've brought my car in for ABS issues - originally I was told that they cleared the error and to bring it back if it happens again. Clear the error? Should've fixed the error as it happened again immediately. Also beware they refer some services to 3rd parties and they won't necessarily write down the information in your file, and then you have to fight with them to find out where to take it when whatever was installed stops working. On top of that they give you attitude, even though you're the one spending 10's of thousands of dollars initially and then more upon repairs. A little kindness, courtesy, and customer service would go a long way.

PS - I don't take my car to Sherwood Nissan to be serviced anymore after they told me I needed to a tire alignment and a wheel rotation (even though my alignment was fine and my tires had been on for 5 days).

But then the drinks aren't even that good--though they are expensive. As is the food. An uninspired menu is one thing, but low-quality bar food served with enough salt to give you instant hypertension (rock salt on the fries), enough grease to lubricate a car's suspension (onion rings), and enough cayenne and jalepeno pepper to set a fire is inexcusable (veggie burger).

The veggie burger was a mash of beans, onions, and pepper with chunks of cheese in it. It tasted microwaved and was slathered with a cheap tasting bbq sauce.  My companions hamburger looked and tasted like the cheapest of the cheap ground chuck.  My plain fries seemed triple salted. His Alley Fries were so salty that one couldn't distinguish the additional seasoning they described on the menu.

Service was OK.  The patio, which could be a very enchanting place is very spartan in terms of garden/landscaping. The inside is an attractive renovation with a huge bar and small side tables. HOwever, the noise level is ultra-loud because there are no sound-absorbing surfaces. The place was about 1/5 full when we arrived and the cacophony rose to ear splitting level as it approached 1/3 full. To the point where you couldn't hear the person sitting across the small table from you.

I also send not one, not two, but three emails to their corporate headquarters and got zero response.

Additionally, ALL of the grass fed beef they advertise is from Australia (not quite local, you might say), plus much of their everyday meet is also from Australia.
Suddenly this feels like someone is trying to pull another corporate fast-one on those of us who want to eat and live healthy.

Not that any of that matters. After all, it's just an opinion.

Having said that, I can say that the Hiro Ramen that I had may be the worst ramen I have ever tasted. The broth was oily with no depth. The pork, while being cut at a nice thickness, was bland and actually a little cold. Where was that torch that someone mentioned in another review? None of the toppings (bamboo) stood out. The egg was a little cold as well and not tasty at all. Noodles were fine. I left behind noodles and broth even though the portion wasn't particularly large. Having said all this, I felt like those $10 were stolen from me.

They also have some appetizers, and I tried the spicy chicken (1st on the menu). It was boiled chicken in a spicy sauce, served cold. The chicken was tender, and the sauce was just spicy enough to tingle the tip of your tongue. Just OK.

After writing my original review (but not the second), I was contacted by management regarding my experience. They began having a technician come out 3 times a week. Additionally, they had their rodent expert from Orlando travel to come assess how rodents were getting into my home. One day I had 3 of their employees here scouring every nook and cranny, and sealing up the holes with wire mesh (which was part of the initial ""Rodent Control"" package I purchased). This was something I was originally assured had been done, but I'm just glad they took the time and attention to finally do it. After that day, they began trapping the rats regularly (sometimes 3 a week).

There came a time where our technician, Tim, was certain they were all gone. We agreed upon leaving some traps in the attic and removing the rest, and I would call if I suspected their were rodents still there. A couple days later, I awoke to a rodent hole chewed into my dog food bin. I contacted Tim, and he placed more traps and has been monitoring the situation.

UPDATE:
Since the last review, Truly Nolen believed they were all gone. Here I am, 1 year from my initial purchase of rodent control from Truly Nolen. We are hearing rats daily again and have seen at least one. None have been caught on the traps. TN found a hole that they had previously sealed reopened by the rats. I recently renewed my rodent control package for $135. I would not have, except that I clearly have an issue, and I don't have the money to shell out $500-$1000 to hire another company. Truly Nolen has claimed this is the hardest time they've ever had to rid a home of rats. If they can't do it, I would like them to tell me it is outside their scope of work and refund my money. This is ridiculous. My husband is now experiencing respiratory problems that we can only contribute to the rodent droppings we are constantly encountering and cleaning. I have invested over a year and over $1000 (the cost for TN plus everything I have had to replace that has been destroyed by the rats), and I am just at my wit's end.",2014-06-11 12:47:38

Roughly 5 years ago I went to see a stylist at the studio Branca Creve Coeur. I have been a regular customer for many years however my current stylist went out on maternity leave so I needed to see somebody new. I should've left with that stylist and never looked back.  Then next time  I went and received the worst haircut I've ever gotten. The stylist nipped, Clipped and messed up my color worse than I could've ever imagined. When I brought it to the attention the next day when I called they told me I would need to pay for color correction. The stylist had messed up on the color, not me. Every time I go and I get very specific directions of what I want for my hair this lady could not handle basic directions--with pictures. 

Therefore I never went back until now. 

I will start by saying Maya in chesterfield was one of the best experiences I've ever had and any spa. Her cut was perfect hair color was even better. I had seen her and started following her on Instagram and decided I would give her a try. I was very happy when I did. Because I haven't been back in so long she offered to give me the new client special which included cut with my color. She offered me also a free facial that came for new clients and I was very excited to use so I immediately booked my appointment. I felt like I made the right decision and giving studio Branca another chance and thought maybe they figured out the value of a good customer. Boy was I wrong! This is when My experience yet again at Creve Coeur turned sour. I had set up my appointment two weeks in advance marked on my calendar and was prepared to go in when this morning I received a call that said I no longer qualify for the promotion because they looked in the record and I have been to the spa before. I explained that yes I have received spa services however I was given this promotion from Maya for this facial because I was a new haircut appointment. The snarky receptionist on the phone told me too bad and that they could not honor that discount and that she will be canceling my appointment. I had booked for an upcharge service of a hydra facial. I was willing to spend an additional hundred + dollars on the promotion that I was given and was willing to pay for derma planning. I asked if they would still honor the promotion because I was willing to do all these additional services and the woman who never took an economics class told me no they would rather have an empty appointment than filling it with a free or discounted facial. Because of the rude receptionist, I will have to strongly
Consider if I ever want to give my business back to studio Branca even though I was very happy with Maya's services. But I would much rather pay somebody else to do a good enough job and have the salon treat its customers with the respect they deserve.",2021-08-31 06:13:28

Good things:

When the manager was approached, our server was exchanged for another server and things turned around quickly. Our new server was on the ball and the manager made things happen. We were finally eating and our drinks were comp'd. 

 THAT BEING SAID.....

If you're going to understaff your restaurant with poorly trained employees, stand behind it. Don't throw them under the bus at the first sign of trouble like it's going to exact any change in the future. Own it. Take one for the team. And maybe comp the part of the bill that was incorrect. 

IF you have a server who is truly a source of frustration to you, either do what it takes to train them more thoroughly, or find a more suitable position for them.

My boyfriend and I decided to dine here for his birthday dinner on our weekend trip in New Orleans, and this happened to be our last dinner in the city. We went out with I'm sorry to report not a ""bang"" but a ""bust.""

We first arrived over 20 minutes before our reservation and were not seated until 15 minutes after, and frankly, they were not that busy at 8.45 that we should have been waiting that long. When we finally sat down we waited 10 minutes just to receive menu's. Our server literally greeted our table and said ""happy birthday"" to my boyfriend (I had told the host to let our server know we were celebrating) and then walked away and never brought us menus. We had to ask another server.

We then decided we were both going to share an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. Our first course was angel hair with crawfish in a creole cream sauce. We waited close to 20 minutes for our appetizer to arrive and when it did, we both wished it had stayed in the kitchen. It was literally one small scoop of pasta that wasn't event cooked right ( it was all stuck together in one small blob, looked unappetizing and was in a a sauce that was utterly bland. We were so hungry by this point we just ate all 2 bites hoping the next few courses would redeem it.

Our next course was a salad with scottish salmon, watermelon, frisee, ricotta salata in a chili lime vinaigrette. This dish was so bad I didn't eat it, I gave it to my boyfriend who was reduced to eating it without breathing saying all the while he felt he was in a tough man competition just trying to get it down. The salmon had a terrible texture and looked like it was out of a can and as my boyfriend put it, it looked like salmon cole slaw. Not something you would expect to see at a restaurant of this caliber.

Then we shared the Pork Chop in the Tamarind and Mole sauce with sweet potatoes. The dish was huge! They split it for us in the kitchen and it still was massive! Th pork chop was cooked well although a little fatty and the sauce was very thick but tasted alright. The sweet potatoes were ehh. 

It's a pretty scary thought that after all this we still took the chance with dessert, but I am glad we did. The banana cream pie was delicious, and although not a saving grace for the terrible food that came before it, we were glad we finally had something tasty to eat. 

However, we were very disappointed that I had mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday and they didn't even put a candle in the pie, or offer us a complimentary dessert or anything. We have been to many other fine dining establishments that go that little extra mile to make you feel special and I feel that our server did not go out of his way to make our evening memorable. A handshake and ""happy birthday"" just doesn't cut it. 

We did have to wait an extremely long time for everything from being seated to receiving our menus, to waiting for the food and then waiting for the check way after we had finished our meal. Our server was busy chatting with some ladies who we assumed worked there and were dining on their night off. 

The highlights of the evening would have be my glass of wine was pretty good although overpriced at 13 a glass, and the busboy who took care of us throughout the evening was great! He was always there to mark our table, clear our plates and refill our water. However, I think its pretty pathetic that we went to a supposed excellent restaurant with a renowned chef and the best thing we can say about the whole experience was the busboy.

I never right reviews. However, I felt the public should be aware of my experience especially if they are going to bring their child for the children's pedicure. This was my first visit at this place, and I went because they have children's pedicure chairs. I was bringing my little girl to get her nails done for the first time. This is how the visit went.

- My daughter moved her toe and messed up the paint on one of her toenails. Jenny was visibly mad and was very short with my daughter. 

- I hadn't realized that earlierJenny had cut my daughter's cuticle, but when she was fixing the paint around the toe she put fingernail polish remover over the cut and my daughter burst into tears. I showed her the cut and told her that this is why my daughter was crying. To make it worse- she did it a second time even after I told her what happened.

- there were several times whereJenny was very upset and talking very angrily to herself in another language, all while being very rough with my daughter. 

- I was told it would be 30 minutes, however my child had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes. Because the wait was longer than expected, I asked Jenny if she could do my daughters nails first. She said that it was her boss' policy that the woman has to get their nails done before the child. I later talked with her boss, the manager- I believe his name was Thomas- and he said that this was not the case. That she can and should have done my daughters nails first. 

If you are going to offer kid's pedicures, you should do just that. Jenny should not expect the child to know exactly what to do or to not move an inch. You should also be a little friendly and definitely not mean and rough - like Jenny. Because the situation kept getting worse and worse. I finally told Jenny that she was much too visibly upset to be touching my daughters nails and that I wanted her to stop. She through the towel down and stormed off. 

If this is something that happened to my, I would not be righting a review. But, for this to be a child's experience, that is unacceptable.",2019-02-02 18:08:30

On both occasions, they found about $1000 of work to be done on the car.

I call my regular mechanic and ask about the specific item (not telling him how much Reedman is going to charge me), and in both cases my mechanic was at about half the price. 

Also, on both occasions, within a few days the vehicle started acting up and doing odd things.  Check engine light pops on, lights on the dash flickering, ABS not working, etc. 

Seems a bit too convenient and spooky.  Like they are deliberating messing with my vehicle so I have to come back and give them more money.    I've never had problems with this Town & Country unless I bring it to Reedman.

Finally a woman came out pleasant but confused on my order. They had my sauces mixed up (not labeled) and made it confusing because we had 3 different kinds. She brought out the order of 80 wings (8 different kinds of flavors) and counted everything to check. Got home and that was when we realized nothing was labeled and we really couldn't tell what most of them were. Got a side of sweet potato fries and they were just thrown into a brown bag with paper on top and the top crinkled all the way down so the fries were soggy on the out side and raw on the inside since they use steak fry cut sweet fries.

I've been a customer for a long time with service contracts at several properties.  This June I called (because I hadn't heard from Lee) to schedule spring a/c check and maintenance-they should've scheduled it with me as they did for years. When I called the operator told me that she would put me on the schedule for October.  October? I said - that's too late.    She said that because it got so hot so fast that they didn't have enough techs for regular maintenance and would only set up an appointment if something broke.   I said I have service contracts on several properties and she said it didn't matter.   She said, 'hopefully nothing will break til October' and I said ""let's hope"".   Fast forward to July.  Early one Sunday morning I hear dripping.  I went to the hvac closet and the a/c unit was rapidly dripping water.  Spilling over the water heater onto the cement and under the wood flooring.  I called to schedule an emergency call - they labeled it a ""work in"" not an ""emergency"" and the tech showed up at 4:00.

I shouldn't have been charged for any call but (according yo John Davis, General Manager) But I was charged $100 and never was reimbursed.   The floor bubbled  up from the damage.  Charlie Roberts, Manager and John Davis said they would fix it and then stopped answering phone calls from us.  Many weeks have gone by and we called our insurance company because the damaged floor is upon entry to our condo and everyone trips on it - it must be fixed. Lee Co walked away from us.  When I called last week and spoke with Lynn, I asked her to cancel my service contracts and get a refund for the contracts because I apparently paid for nothing.  told her the whole story and she was sympathetic saying that she was familiar with me and that I was a good customer and always very nice and she would check with her manager and call me back.

I am tolerable with weird/bad tasting things and will normally try to eat everything b/c I don't like to waste food, but this time I cut out all the egg white out and ate just the english muffin, ham, and the runny yolk.

I got all white gel-a really hot trend for summer SIX DAYS AGO. It shouldn't matter what the color is, though..it's called 'no-chip shellac' for a reason. 
Day 2 I had to return because two of the nails were starting to chip, and another was looking too thick and lifting up... instead of them seeing what was wrong, the lady filed down the two chipped and sent me off. I had to come back the next day once again due to two more cracking and chipping...Needless to say, I had to go back FIVE times over the last week, and even got charged $18 to repair two, including one acrylic that popped completely off. Absolutely ridiculous. Who has time or monday to do this???

Well, I went back in yesterday and asked to talk to somebody who spoke a little bit more English, to which they didn't understand, and they did end up sending some guy over to repair yet another two nails that had chipped (these were the original two nails that had chipped, haha), and they re-did them at no charge.
I woke up this morning and nearly half of both of my middle fingers have lifted/chipped off.

At first I thought this was due to possibly 3 coats or something, but the last 2 attempts at this, they only did it twice.

Based on other reviews we expected a great visit with our kids having an opportunity to see animals. Ultimately, most exhibits were moved, in transition, closed or only accessible to a greater degree if you paid out additional money to feed the animals a lettuce leaf. For example, the bison were blocked by the lettuce attendants. While holding my daughter I clarified....""so we cannot walk ten steps past you to take a picture and see the buffalo?"" No they declared the deck is only if you pay for a lettuce leaf. Linking at the pavement and pointing out we were not approaching the deck, we were walking straight on the pavement, you are or are not saying that we cannot move forward?"" The attendant corrected himself finally saying that is fine, but the glares we got made the interest in the exhibit wane, it was really uncomfortable! Reminder to zoo, we did pay the admission fee. They have cute rides for the kids, but again, major disappointment! Please know that if your child would like to ride the carousel you have to pay full price admission to ride yourself!! An embarrassing policy that the Admissions office declared was in place because of their insurance requirements. After the two minute ride for my two kids and husband we left. I was sad for my children and us that our full price regular admission was not really an admission, but rather one with limitations......unless you have the extra money to pay for all the upgrades apparently.

Tiesto was doing a show at the Liacouras Center at Temple and was there till like 11:30pm, then zoomed over to Soundgarden Hall to start his set at 1:20 a.m., not a problem.  But the venue itself kind of sucks.  We got the reserved table out on the floor which was supposed to come with unlimited mixers and a tub of ice (see below for problem with that).  We got showed to our table after waiting for about 20 minutes through the confusion of the front door trying to figure out where to put us.  But then we were eventually showed to our table which ironically enough must have been the best table there because it was right on the floor and pretty much dead center with the long rectangular dance floor.  So the location was great because we could literally drink while pretty much being on the dance floor (which they don't allow otherwise).

But it took them about 45 minutes to an hour to get someone over to A) clean our table off because people had been using it before we got there, B) get the tub of ice with mixers.  They did give us four (4) red bulls to make up for it (which I'm sure they were probably $10 a piece if you bought them there).  But getting from the front door to the table was a pretty decent mess (although from the previous reviews, I think they are getting better cuz they at least had like 3 girls with clip boards trying to help us out).

Other than that, the pillars are annoying and I honestly couldn't see Tiesto.  I got up pretty far and it's almost like he was behind some silk screen or in the back cuz I couldn't see him at all, even when I was all the way up.  They have tvs with cameras so you can ""see the DJ"" if you aren't the lucky few up front and it was just graphics.  I kind of question whether he was really there or not. 

Honestly, the best part about the place is the BYOB.  My friends and I can drink a ton so we easily would have spent close to a $100+ on mixed drinks so paying for the ticket and another $50 a head for mixers/ice/our table was worth it, especially because the 21 and over part was elevated and you couldn't see shit from there so I would recommend getting the reserved table.  Just get there like an hour earlier than you normally would to counteract the waiting in line (which wasn't too bad), the confusion when you get in there, etc.  But once in there, it's not bad as long as you're drinking.  If not, then this place is NOT for you, lol.",2013-02-25 14:29:00

The out-the-door price, though, was around $615 (not including alignment). That's $175 for fees and labor. I called Costco, who quoted me $589 out the door.  Suddenly, Sears was able to drop the price to $599, so I just let them do the work.  The guy we were working with only seemed to want to deal with my husband, though it was my car and I was the one paying.  Later, he called to let my husband know that both the front and back needed alignment.

I was pretty disappointed since this is supposed to be a Steak house. I order the rib eye and I know there is usually a fair amount of fat normally but no exaggeration this was at least 30% fat. They did not comp anything. The chef did apologize for the mishap but that was about all. I go to this casino often and spend a lot of money there. I will not return to this place.

Friday's in general is starting to get ahead of itself. It's going down the Outback and Applebees road where they re do the inside, add some fancy words to the menu, and jack up their prices. It's simply just not worth it anymore. 

Endless apps were the best bang for your buck after looking over the menu. Our server was nice in explaining the process. Your first app is a bigger portion and the apps following that are small portions. The Memphis BBQ wings were my first choice and lacked sauce. They were almost plain wings with a drizzle of sauce. The flat bread was average the mozzarella sticks lacked cheese (see my photo). 

Everything else that came afterwards was barely warm and just wasn't very good.

If I'd known this place had been featured on that Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show I never would have gone here in the first place; also the Google reviews are seriously misleading and I wish I'd checked Yelp rather than just being too hungry to bother ::sigh::

Therefore I give you:

*The New Orleans Brunch HostageCon 2017, or, A Tale of Server-Induced Stockholm Syndrome *

TL;DR: Don't go here. Stay away. Avoid at all costs. There are so many amazing places to eat in New Orleans, and this isn't one of them, for SO many reasons. 

Okay, I'll give you this - if my group of six friends and I had had a better server, perhaps I would be giving this restaurant, say, 2.5 stars. Maybe even 3. But we didn't have a better server; we had the older woman who is...one of the owners? Or has maybe just worked there forever? Who knows, though there's a portrait of her by the bathrooms so she's obviously important, and that's scary because she was scary.

First things first - the food is nothing special. Definitely not as good as other restaurants in the French Quarter, and honestly we only ended up here because the wait at my preferred restaurant (Stanley in Jackson Square) was too long. Personally I had the blintzes with ""strawberries"" (aka strawberry jam, wtf) and a side of home fries (which were barely lukewarm when they arrived). I also tried my boyfriend's roast beef po'boy, which was actually pretty good as roast beef po'boys go, but again...certainly not AMAZING.

Anyway, our experience began with us waiting close to 10 minutes to get seated despite the fact that the restaurant was almost entirely empty. There was no host at the door, we had to flag someone down, and then that person disappeared again for several minutes before finally returning and setting up a table for us.

Once seated, we waited some more! Seriously, at least another ten minutes, possibly longer, before our server finally came by with waters. Since we'd been walking around trying to find a place to eat, and then waited so long to get said waters, we were thirsty...which led to the following exchange:
Boyfriend (very pleasantly, mind you): ""Can I get some more water?""
Server: ""Wha? No, oh no, I ain't running back and forth bringing you water. Not gonna happen. You can wait - I've got a SYSTEM.""

This ""system"" entailed her constantly reassuring that she would bring us more water - a PITCHER of water! how GENEROUS! - but oh wait she didn't do that until after we were almost done eating. Which was, by the way, over an hour after we sat down in the first place. The entire experience lasted more than hour and a half, and not once but TWICE our server disappeared to ""sit down and take a rest"". The first time she didn't say anything; we just didn't see her for 20 minutes. The second time she warned us that she was going to rest...and then ignored our request for the check.

And oh, just to warn you, checks for large parties can only be paid on a single credit card or in cash. Not that we were surprised after being held hostage there for an hour and a half, but you know, might as well put that out there.

I'm not kidding when I say we couldn't ask for ANYTHING without getting a retort from this woman. It was so bad that by the end we were all mumbling 'thank you' every time she came around regardless of whether or not she was actually doing anything worthy of being thanked. It was legitimately SCARY to the point of wondering if we'd ever get out of there. Honestly, even if this food was the absolute best food in New Orleans (and yet again, need I remind you, it wasn't) it still wouldn't have been worth this experience.

You know that song ""You're Welcome"" that Maui sings in Disney's Moana? Someone should write an Old Coffee Pot version of that for this server to sing. Only in the end know that you won't be as strong as Moana. You'll give in and say thank you and then feel sick to your stomach about everything that's happened.

But you know, at least you'll probably get a good story out of it. Obviously we did.",2017-03-22 13:32:09

She then gave me a refund and said she would still give me my pizza but as soon as she gave me the money back ran off to the kitchen again. Not to mention there was a line of people behind me waiting for hours for their pizza as well. The delivery woman who's attention we tried to grab had a ridiculous attitude with us basically implying that her delivery orders were more important than the line of people behind me. The girl running around working the cash register was very out of it and they simply did not care how long they made the customers wait for their orders as if our time was less valuable. She tried explaining that there was no prep done for them coming in this morning. I was very disappointed and will never be back in this Pizza Hut ever again!!

I was nearby with my 7-year-old daughter and figured since one of the restrictions was eat-in that we'll go order our meal and whatever was left over, take home. They have two double-door entrances with one locked and no signs saying to use the other one or how to actually enter the restaurant. So we enter and an older waitress says eat-in or to go, we say in so she says come around. Still not sure where to go because it's like two separate areas and it looks like you have to go into the waitress area to get to the other side. We finally sit down and a waitress (40ish) comes over. I immediately joke and tell her I have a Groupon and the story how I thought the restaurant was closer to me and she all but cuts me off. ""You have to use the entire amount now and you can't take any home"".  I'm like okay but I can take home any pizza we don't eat right? ""No! Everything has to be eaten here, it's too expensive to do take out containers."" So we go back and forth and finally, I say I'll come back because we aren't' going to be eating over $30 of food and finish it all today. So as I'm walking to my car I'm thinking it over and think, that's crazy. Let me go back in. I'll never make it back up here again. I go to the counter to a different woman and tell her and she says ""what did she say?"" As I'm telling her the original woman pops up out of nowhere and says ""I told him it's too expensive for take-out containers. We have people come in and order one pizza and then get another to go.""
Now if that's the case then they are making out great. Pizza dough is cheap! The deal is for $30 bucks so you just got off with 2 pizzas that cost you way less than what the food cost is on your menu. I even offered to pay for the pizza box or containers in the middle of our argument. Finally, she agreed if there isn't a lot of food then a container is fine. So we sat down and looked over the menu. I watched 3 women a booth away (they sat down just prior to us walking out) order two pies and then tell the same waitress that they have a Groupon on her phone. They didn't receive a verbal warning or conditions on their order. 
As she came over to take my order, I even apologized for the argument and we ended up starting to argue again so I just let it go. 
I order the most expensive item on the menu- Veal and ask for it as Franchese (it wasn't offered that way on the menu-just the chicken prepared that way), an order of fries and a large plain pizza. The bill comes out to around $40ish minus the $30 Groupon. 
So now I just ordered the most expensive item on your menu but you're worrying about take-out containers. If you don't like Groupon deals/business then DON'T offer them!!! If you are offering them it's because your business hasn't been as good as it should be and you are relying on that to bring in revenue. So you just brought in a new customer and completely lost them. The pizza and the food were actually pretty good and I would have returned if I was at the nearby movies or the Montgomery Mall sometime. This is literally one of the longest Yelp reviews I've ever written just to say how unappreciated I felt going into the store. Why did the women in the nearby booth using the same deal not get chastised?

Efforts to make eye contact with a server went unnoticed. And the cheeseburger arrived without spinach and without cheese. Mistakes in the kitchen can be worked out. No worries, but when I told the waiter that my burger was supposed to be a cheeseburger, he replied that ""it is a cheeseburger."" Now, you can see the picture - it's a bun-less burger... with no cheese. That's plain to see. So unless someone has invented invisible cheese, he'd be incorrect in his correction.

I've been to Chef Ma's several times and always been really pleased with the food and the experience. I've recommended it to a lot of friends. My fiancée is Chinese and he loves the food, too. 

Tonight I was meeting my mom and my cousin who is visiting from out of town. We had told her in advance we really like this place, and we were all excited to eat there.

When I arrived, it seemed like they didn't have enough tables to seat me. They told me they had several reservations soon. I asked if I should leave, but was told no. I was seated at a big table, then told to move to a smaller one, then back to the big one. I was told it would be okay if we could ""eat fast."" 

Our food came quickly and we ate quickly. The food was great! But the service was no. Nobody ever came to ask how it was, give us drink refills, etc. We felt very rushed, and like we were an imposition. It was weird.

My mom went to the counter to pay, and because the service was so poor she did not leave a tip. The lady said ""you did not pay for the service."" My Mom said she paid for the food, but the service was bad. The lady said ""well then you can clean your own plates."" 

My mom then signed the receipt, walked back to the table, and said we needed to leave. The lady came out from behind the counter, and pushed the cart with the dirty dishes bin between us and the door. She said ""if you could clean up all the dishes it would be greatly appreciated.""

We actually couldn't leave without moving the cart, it was blocking our exit. My cousin and I were confused and so I took one plate and put it in the bin. I didn't know about the lady's comment to my mom at the counter and had no idea what was going on. My mom said ""no, we are not cleaning the table"" and told us to leave. She explained when we got outside.

I have finally found my elusive Holy Grail: the worst meal I have eaten in 40 years of life. I didn't even know I was searching for it, but when it was served to me yesterday, I immediately recognized it. A masterpiece of awful. I was just sad it was in this particular restaurant, which, from the outside, had always intrigued me since its days as the Dew Drop Inn (get it? get it?). But this minor disappointment was just one of many I experienced during my first--and last--meal at Bruno's.

First, the praise: The coffee was drinkable, though after the meal we had I would not have been surprised had it been utter swill. And the server was friendly, though not particularly attentive, and disappeared for long stretches, though the place was fairly empty.

Now, the blame: How on earth can you screw up a turkey club? a TOSSED SALAD, for God's sake? How dare you serve such an awful cheesesteak, in Philadelphia of all places? And we're not even picky eaters. We'll eat at Applebee's and Houlihan's. We have eaten at nearby Sorrento's, which (at least on the night I went 10 years ago) served pretty terrible spaghetti. I will eat synthetic whipped cream on saltines, if there's nothing else at home, and find it reasonably palatable. But I can't imagine returning to choke down the dry-beyond-belief turkey in my sandwich or the gristly and congealed-looking meat in my companion's cheesesteak. (Did I mention the burned, almost charcoal-y bread on the club?)

If you wish to end up digging out lettuce and tomato in your sandwich with a fork in an attempt to forage for sustenance, by all means go to Bruno's.

It's a used car so I know of minor issues and wear and tear.  What I was not told was that the car was in an accident.  The windshield leaked on the one weekend that it actually rained in California, so that was $145.00 repair for a mild fix.  To be fixed properly the windshield requires to be removed, cut out, where it could possibly break, replaced if it breaks and remounted. That would cost more.  Las week they found a crack in the radiator, that was a $1,200.00 job.  This past Saturday the wiring went nuts and I couldn't tell the speed I was going, if I had gas in the car, if it was heating up or was at normal temperature because the mechanic who worked on my car knew there was an issue and tried to cover it up by putting in a fuse that was too high in voltage so it blew and caused an electrical malfunction.  The mechanic that is working on it now (LAND ROVER EXPERT) had a fuse blow up on him when he tried replacing it and my car started to smoke.  What the hell man.  I have been without a car since Saturday and the repairs could be in the thousands.  I am financing the rest of the car so if it's too much to fix, I am left without a car that is a dud and a loan. Meanwhile they have my perfect car still in the lot.  Adam said that they can't do anything about it.  I've had the car less then a month!!!! how could you not.  I know that I bought it as is, but can't you do ANYTHING at all???? don't you give a damn about people that trusted you and your dealership to sell them a car in the condition that YOU said the car was in.

One of the worst dine-in experiences ever.

The dine in side of the restaurant is very dirty, all the tables sticky and there were several flies.  Bathroom was a real nasty place, dirty toilets and fixtures hanging everywhere.  No air conditioning!!!

The service was very very very poor and slow moving (the waitress seemed to have a mental disability, likely down syndrome) which might of made things worse.  Now look, yes I had to go there cause what's a yelp review without the truth?? Definitely don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings here, but stating the truth.  We didn't come here for charity, we came here for good food and good service, but that was not possible.  There were only 4 customer tables at the time and it seemed like an impossible challenge for her.  She was the type that didn't write anything down, and tried to memorize.

We asked for napkins 4 times before she actually brought only 3 napkins to us (there was 5 of us).  Same for other items we asked for, asked for vinegar but got a weird dressing instead. 

Also the pizza margherita was cold and nasty.  Everything was cold except the stromboli.  French fries were gross and cold and so were the chicken fingers.  She only brought out 2 plates for the pizza, no plate, fork or knives for the rest.  It was impossible to flag her down.  

Kitchen was very loud, lots of things being dropped and banged and every time she walked to deliver something, her feet making a loud annoying sliding noise.

She was somewhat polite to give her at least some credit for something.  She was apologizing to everyone every 5 minutes.  No one was getting their orders correct and also missing napkins, forks, straws.  Felt like a hidden camera prank or something.  Jesus Christ! But I guess in part of her defense, the place was very understaffed IMHO, especially for her capabilities handling the dine-in side alone. The opposite take out side had 3 employees chatting at the counter hanging out!  They should of helped.  She should of asked or at the very least, the manager should of done his/her job!!! Bunch of BS.

The label was generated on February 28th. Wedgewood insists that the delay was due to the time it took to compound the drug, but by their own admission, a label isn't generated until after the compounding happens. You can't have it both ways.

Secondarily, it was their own customer service rep that couldn't find the delivery and communicated that it wouldn't be sent out until the 4th.

Update: Meds were actually delivered today (about a week later). Despite the customer service rep stating on March 3rd that the meds would be sent out March 4th (and the tracking number not having been updated either), the meds showed up and are slated to be delivered today March 4th.

I've increased the rating, but removed 1 star for what seems like Wedgewood losing the delivery in their system, and 1 star for having an internal policy that they can not make any changes to the order once the ""label has been printed,"" despite it being printed before the rx is even compounded.

Hope your pet doesn't actually need the meds. Ordered an urgent rx called in by my vet for my dog with cancer. Sent a shipping label almost immediately. Nearly a week later, it's still awaiting pickup.

Called up, and the woman snidely stated they need 1-2 days to compound an rx. Regardless, a week is not 1-2 days. When we inquired about expediting they shipping, they said there was nothing that could be done since the label was already created.

The bar was set pretty high for this restaurant, as my family & I used to frequently dine here. We haven't been back in a few years due to relocating.
While we stayed at the Peppermill across the street, the opportunity arose to come back for some yummy, authentic chinese food. So, we jumped on it & came by to grab some food to go. 
Upon arrival, we were greeted by blank stares.. From everyone including the employees. 
It was awkward. I felt like we were intruding.  After a minute or so, an employee came up to us (never said hello,) & asked if we were dining in or placing an order to go. We said we wanted to order to go & she directed us to the front counter & gave us menus. She came back to take our order a few minutes later. In the middle of taking our order, she randomly walked away. We felt really rushed to order.. 
Our bill came out to be 31$. I would've rather went to Panda Express! Atleast Panda Express can make better chow mein & chinese food in general, for way cheaper. 
We don't mind paying for quality food, but during this last visit, we felt really let down. Our food had no flavor. It wasn't made with love & that was evident. More so, just cooked & thrown together. 
Our crab rangoons were frozen & then fried. They had very little filling & I couldn't find any crab meat inside.  
I could've bought frozen crab rangoons from the store & fried them at home.
Neither myself nor my family, will be back.
This place has greatly changed over the years.. Not for the better!

Even when they do a return (not a VOID as you think they would), it puts a hold on the funds for all the amounts charged for up to THREE DAYS, before your funds get released back to you and the errant charges fall off because of THEIR MISTAKE.

My husband rented a car for a few days from here while in town for business. When he returned the vehicle and way paying, he noticed that they nearly doubled his rate to the tune of $400+ because they added the insurance that he declined and also charged him the wrong amount. So they guy behind the counter apologizes, but rather than VOID the previous transaction, he just issues a return, and charges my husband's card AGAIN, but forgets to adjust the price to the original quote. Now we're up to $700+ in charges. Guy realizes his mistake, does a return AGAIN, then finally charges the correct amount. Now the total for all 3 charges is over $1000!

He would not have been able to board his flight with his luggage, have had to borrow money somehow, and/or probably not have made it to his next gig, which would have been THREE WEEKS of lost wages. And all because of utter incompetence of the people at this Dollar rental car place. 

It gets better, though... because all the guy and his manager did was shrug their shoulders and give a half-hearted apology. When my husband became upset upon seeing all the money drafted out of his account, the manager pulled up their transactions and said that the previous two errant charges were no longer in their system and that he had only been charged once, which was the final the correct amount. And yet, right there on his phone looking at his account were a total of THREE transactions instead of the one correct that Dollar conveniently only showed in their system. Husband called our bank, they said they could do nothing as it was an issue with Dollar's bank. 

*AAAAAAAARGGHGGHGHGHHHRGDUFIHDBCISHSVDHXHDHDHEIDB FHEIOAKWhegcveiwiHEHDBXBUZI!!!!!!!!!!*

My husband is a patient man, but he was hyperpissed and ready to raise hell because of how nonchalantly these asshats treated him despite THEIR mistake. They did NOTHING to try to make it up to him nor truly make an attempt to rectify the situation. Their attitude was basically, ""Oops, oh well. You're shit out of luck. Next!"" When he called me to tell me, I was infuriated and told him to call Dollar Rental's corporate number. It being a Friday evening, the call centers were CONVENIENTLY CLOSED!! NO FREAKING HELP THERE! 

Just. Don't. Bother! 
Your sanity is worth more than a few Dollars saved!

I'm convinced now more than ever that I am *WILLING* to pay more for convenience and outstanding customer service, versus a cheap car rental charged three times with no immediate recourse and no help from the offending party. Go elsewhere, please!",2016-11-13 17:07:25

So I was going to purchase a Groupon for the $189 package but I called the store, as recommended, just to find out if there was additional cost for the install. As the reviews stated the sales guy sold me hands down on how great the wax works team was and that I'd be taken care of, he even told me they would match the price for the groupon without me having to buy the package through Groupon. So I set the appointment and I was excited to go the following week @ 11:00. I arrived on time and I was greeted by the friendly staff and asked if I wanted to wait there or leave my car. I was told they were behind ( a little) so I asked a friend to pick me up and I'd go to lunch and they would call me when it was ready.

I'm not happy but I say ok call me. I wait another two hours and call back to find out it won't be ready until about 6:00 pm,. I'm pretty upset now and tired so I arrive at the shop now about 6:00 and it's still not ready. Another half hour and I go to pay and the cost was double what I was told. I pay and leave upset about the whole ordeal. On email home I noticed something on the floor near my leg, it was the hood latch, I open the driver door to see a long crack all the way down the panel where the techs went into and under to install. I immediately call and speak with the manager and was told to bring it back in. I get there and it's checked out and I was told he would order and replace the panel and the latch was put back in place. I asked why they would damage my car and no one said anything? He apologized and I left after I'm told I'd get a call when the part came in. Two weeks later my car begins to have starting issues and won't turn on. It appears something was improperly installed so the security system is engaged and will not start now. Trying to reach the manager now and he is no where available!!!

A small seating/dining area to the left, is surrounded by a raw foods book shelf, fridge, and a blend of homemade raw delicacies.

The food menu is not posted, but I did pick up a menu which looks intriguing. I was warmly greeted by his daughter ( I think,) perused around and ended at the counter, where the owner was standing. I asked for a smoothie, and was unenthusiastically served a banana-tasting smoothie (although bananas were not in the ingredient list.) I felt as if I were almost a bother to him; as he handed me the small cup and said, ""Are you done?"" I said yes, and asked where to pay and he walked over to the register and rung me up something like five dollars for some kale and celery juice.

I needed an (apparently) very obscure hair product that was probably much more popular in the 80's  (that crazy spray on temporary hair color stuff - a great addition to any costume or themed party!).  So now I'm somewhat of an expert on CVS stores and Walgreens.

This CVS was a creeper.... even at 3 in the afternoon.  

Its in a bad neighborhood, and the parking lot is awkwardly huge, so it makes the neighborhood look even worse because there is a ton of asphalt with this square CVS building in the middle.  There were kids loitering with their ADORABLE white bulldog who I wanted to pet (but I was scared of the kids lol) - They were getting eyed by the employees the whole time.  I got the feeling like theft and general criminal acts might be a common fear of the employees.  Everyone seemed a little on edge.

 The store is much bigger than the others, but half of it is devoted to beer and liquor so it doesn't make the selection any better than the other locations.  That being said, they didn't have what I needed :/  So I walked out.... the wrong way.... I ended up in the entrance turn around thing that I wasn't supposed to be in - so the layout out is a bit strange.  

A while later I was in the neighborhood and needed some Tylenol and figured it would be MUCH cheaper at CVS than the Raleys across the street (it was like 10pm this time, and MUCH creepier).  I asked to use their bathroom and they said No, only for paying customers.  So I grabbed my Tylenol and asked again at the checkout stand (since I was a paying customer).  They kinda looked at me, and looked at each other, and said, no we locked it cause we are closing in 30 minutes.   Oh darn :(   Honestly its totally understandable since I bet they have bums trying to use their bathrooms all the time - to take showers in the sink and stuff - but just so others know, if you have a potty emergency don't pull into CVS, drive on down to the McDonald's maybe :)

All in all, it is a CVS almost like any other - but I say keep on driving to the next nearest pharmacy  (I like the one on California/Mayberry).",2010-07-11 21:06:14

The spinach salad was an amateur production, 99% spinach and 1% blue cheese and candied nuts. On top of that, the salad was horribly ""dry"". My son had the lobster. It was tasteless & chewy. So chewy, that 70-80% of the lobster ended up in my son's napkin because it was not edible. I had the soft shell crabs which were a featured special of the day. I have had soft shell crabs at least 3 dozen times in various restaurants, and I can say with complete confidence that these were the worst I have ever ordered. They should have never been put on the menu. The shell was impossible to cut with my knife, and extremely greasy.It was as if I was eating egg shells. I literally had to use my knife to pierce the side of the shell and then remove what little meat was there. The sides were a broccoli and carrots. The broccoli was fine but the carrots were seriously undercooked. The other side that I had was mashed sweet potatoes. Here again, just poor preparation, unlike the other items, the sweet potatoes were over-spiced and littered with stringy outer-layer which any good chef knows should be cut-off before prepararing. Equal to the bad meal was the unattentive waiter. We were one of only three tables seated, and there were 3-4 servers. Our server was MIA (missing in action). It was sadly comical. Our drink glasses were empty a majority of the time. He never came back to question the fact that we left the majority of our meal. He was just oblivious.

We paid $85pp for the dinner jazz cruise and the minute we walked on we should've turned around. We walk into a dining room where we were the youngest people there (we are in our 30's, I would say the average was 60yo). The food was a buffet of soggy salad, store bought cornbread muffins, some sad looking pasta, and a prime rib that wasn't terrible. When we sat at our table, we waited a while to order drinks and eventually just approached the bar ourselves. As we were about to pay the hostess approaches and says ""dont charge them for their drinks, the waiter forgot that was his table""... while the waiter was standing beside him!  Though the gesture of a free drink was nice, it made the rest of the night completely awkward with the waiter apologizing and trying hard to overcome the rocky start.  After dinner we went to the top deck to see the view.  The first 5 minutes was nice with the twinkling skyline of the city but the following hour was nothing to see but big ugly boats as it's too dark to see anything on shore.  The jazz band playing at the top of the boat was really good (hence the 2 star rating) but there was not enough seating for everyone to have a view of them and all surrounding seats were so wet from a light rain that we gave up and spent most of the cruise on a bench with zero view of anything at all.  My suggestion is to forego the night cruise, do to a nice dinner with live music and you'll surely have better food and a better time. If you absolutely want to ride the (nasty) boat then do so in the daytime and don't bother paying for the food.",2019-11-12 17:45:28

The two installers were nice and on time and finished in one day, which I was impressed with. However, this is probably because they rushed the install and the quality of work was lacking. They forgot to nail down some of the quarter round and I later noticed that one of them accidentally left a huge gash in my wall while using a saw to cut the laminate.
A few months later, I noticed that the laminate was warping up at some joints. Additionally, the transition bar into the kitchen looks horrendous. Glue had seeped out onto the floor and the bar has shifted and the layer of ""wood"" look is peeling and cracking off of the bar exposing the laminate core. When the salesman sold us these floors, he said they were pet and wear-proof, which is a complete lie.
After an inspector finally came out- they showed up weeks after they were supposed to randomly at my house (thankfully I was home)- it took weeks for the customer service rep to get back to me. The results of the inspection were that I was cleaning the floors wrong. I was ""mopping them"" instead of cleaning them with a dry cloth and spray. I have NO idea where they got this information because if he had even asked, I would have gladly showed them the expensive DRY microfiber mop and LAMINATE floor SPRAY cleaner that I use to clean those floors. They told me I have to pay $2000 to fix it because of this ""incorrect"" cleaning, for which this accusation was pulled literally out of thin air.
I am extremely dissatisfied and angry, especially since I feel that I overpaid for the floors in the first place. The salesman was extremely pushy and threatened to leave when we would not pay the ridiculous amount that he suggested. When we finally agreed to ""help him out"" by paying for recarpeting our bedroom, we were able to settle at an amount finally, that I also feel was too much money. It was an overall excruciating experience, as he was at our house for over 3 hours.
Overall this experience is something I would not wish on anyone, and now we are stuck with shitty damaged floors because of a rushed install and shitty customer service.",2017-08-21 16:40:27

The first year was mostly fine, tolerable is probably a good word. As others have posted, there are some seriously messed up plumbing issues. We got a call one day to stop using our kitchen sink because every time we ran water in there it was coming up the sink of our downstairs neighbor and flooding her kitchen. A few months later, we were noticing a horrendous smell in our kitchen. We discovered that there was standing poop water in our dishwasher and the dishwasher wouldn't turn on. It took 2 days for them to come to fix it. And by fix it I mean they got it to run a cycle but didn't clean it out or have any concern as to why there is poop water coming up into our dishwasher. Needless to say we don't use the dishwasher anymore. New owners took over this complex in October maybe? Not sure exactly when because residents were not made aware of this until suddenly notices began appearing on our door stating that we had to remove our holiday decor from our windows or we would be evicted. Never mind that the people living 2 staircases over have their entire front patio decorated, all the stair railings, and even the bushes on the ground. They target people who they have, for unknown reasons, decided to hate, and they make their lives a living hell with their notices and threats of eviction for the most absurd things. Another issue is that we are not allowed to have tv in this complex anymore. Unless you want to sell your soul to Comcast and pay hundreds of dollars a month just to have the Internet, then you are out of luck. When we moved in, there were satellite dishes at the majority of the apartments here. New owners came in and had them all taken down and told people they were out of luck. Directv guy asks me what kind of deal we are getting at Comcast through the apartment. Hahahahahaha that's hilarious! There is no deal. Comcast or nothing. Unfortunately we were not made aware of the new nazi owners until it was past the ridiculous 2 month notice that you have to give to move out when your lease is up, so we are stuck here living in this prison of poop water, new hideous circus paint scheme, moldy bathrooms, and cockroaches for another year. And, while taking away more and more amenities (the so called gym is ALWAYS broken and the pools are continually locked shut), they jacked up our rent after quoting us a completely different price before we went in to sign the actual lease. The list of complaints could go on for days. Save yourself the trouble and just keep on going past this hellhole.

This horrendous shit hole is a health hazard. Toxic black mold has been found in 3 places in our apartment now. They are trying to say there was a ""leak"" from the water heater which magically fixed itself.

Today, I ordered delivery of a meatball app, kid's meal, Penne a la Vodka with extra chicken, and a side of TWO chicken breasts. I was charged $46, which puts the value of those TWO chicken breasts around $16 (probably a little less). As I'm on a diet, I have to measure my chicken breast. Those TWO chicken breasts weighed less than 4 oz. I called up to politely explain that they gave me one, but the manager refused to believe me and continued to argue that they gave me 8oz of meat explaining that the meat probably shrank during cooking. Shrank in half!? I asked the manager the same question. She replied that indeed the meat probably did shrink in half.

Second, the rolls I had were pretty sloppy. The refined and delicate nature of most Japanese food is one of the main things I love about it. 

I ordered 2 rolls, which was way too much food for one person. That's fortunate, because I didn't care for the flavor of the Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll and threw most of it away . It was very garlicky, which didn't work for me, even as ""sushi.""  It also had an acrid flavor under the garlic and spice. The crunchiness was pleasant and appropriate. The construction of the roll was fine. 

I ate most of my other roll, which was a Surf and Turf roll. The flavor was good and very ""short-ribby.""  The roll was poorly constructed probably because it's lettuce on the outside.  It was very hearty, which was a little unsettling. But I liked it.

So I got off the phone and called Graham Saab explained to the service manager what was happening with my car, he immediately quoted me a price to replace the ballast and labor which was several hundred dollars less than Ayers. He also gave me a timeline of when they would have the ballast in after I would order it which Ayers wouldn't give me. I went to Ayers to get my car and it took the owner Robert almost 20 minutes to get to me even though there was no other customers in the shop because he was busy doing something with his personal car.

I took my car paid way to much for them doing absolutely nothing to my car and got the hell out of dodge!!! Graham got the ballast in 5 days and replaced it about 2 hours.

One member of our party ordered a half bottle of wine. She was brought one glass. When we pointed this out to the server, she returned with a second glass. However, the half bottle was still on the bill at the end of the meal. The server also had to be asked to bring a clean glass after we were served one with several flying bugs in it. As a result, out of the 3 people in our party, 2 chose not to tip and I was one of them. The other member of our party left a $12 tip out of guilt. 

Imagine my surprise when I looked at my credit card statement and found $12 added to the total I charged. It took my bank interceding to rectify this. A lot of restaurants will place a hold of anywhere from 8-10% on the initial charge, and it falls off later once the charge goes through.

""Absinthe, please.""

""We have (she rattled off three or four different kinds).""

""What kind do you recommend?""

""I hate all of it.""

""Just give me the last one.""

And that she did.  With the grace and care of Rosie the Riveter on an assembly line, she plopped the glass down, poured some green liquid in, and set a sugar cube on fire.  

""That'll be ten bucks, babe.""

Ordered a set of 24 Christmas Fortune Cookies from them for a family Christmas dinner with an idea what a great way it would be for every family member to have a fortune/wish for the New Year. The wishes/fortunes inside the cookies were very dull and automatic (copied from google), had no creativity or personalization whatsoever and there were literally only 4 or 5 different fortunes out of the 24 cookies meaning most people got the same fortune... Most of the cookies arrived smashed and broken. Definitely would recommend a more intact and sturdy packaging. 

I have ordered fortune cookies before from a different source and they were actually very personalized, different, and interesting to read!

Only giving credit for fast and timely delivery, competent pricing, and rich selection.

After they get your money, you are dead to them.  If you have any questions, concerns, complaints, they don't care and they won't answer their phones.

As for the product they sell, it's crap.  I bought a 2018 Salem by Forest River at the very end of March 2018.  Here is the problems I have had:

 AC junction box fire on the water heater.  We have now been without an electric water heater for 3 weeks?  This was due to a wire nut not being properly installed. 

Air Conditioning continues to freeze up.  Also, the AC does not cool properly.  Additionally, the actual controls to the AC have stopped working.  We have bought two additional portable AC units.  We were also told we should have bought a 50 amp which had 2 AC units.  Too bad we were not even offered that.  

Breaker box inside the camper is routinely at 140+ degrees.  This is not normal.

Bathroom door window leaks water, adding to the humidity inside the travel trailer.

Kitchen drawers will not stay shut. 

Multiple drawers in the camper are splitting.

Sensor for the black water tank constantly reads 2/3 full although the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis.

Internal breakers for the camper are constantly tripped despite having a low load.

Outside speaker is already not working properly and cracking when music plays.

Pieces of trim throughout the camper are coming lose, falling off.

Multiple blinds now no longer retract, and one literally fell out of the wall.

Shelving was installed upside down throughout the travel trailer.

Wall is separating from the frame in the bathroom.

Wall is separating from the frame in the bedroom.

Bunkhouse ceiling is beginning to sag.

Black liquid is leaking from the bedroom wall where the staples are indicating a water leak.  Obviously this water leak may be from the ceiling of even an improperly sealed window.  Water damage equals mold which is a serious health hazard.

The refrigerator is literally falling out of the bracket that holds it in.

The AC barely works, and even running it full blast, the temperature stays around 75-70 with a humidity even higher unless it's the middle of the night.

Now, it's an argument between Forest River and Camping 
World on who is going to do what.  Last I was told was I needed to haul it and hour and a half away to have someone look at it.  No offer to pick it up, nothing.  Do essentially, if you buy from here make sure you have a lawyer on retention because you're gonna need it even after they sell you a lemon.

The elevators sound like they're going to fall apart any day now.

The food in their restaurant is very generic, and therefore extremely overpriced.  My wife had a burger and fries for $20.  The breakfast was $15 per person as well, and that was the buffet.  Very expensive for liquid eggs and other generic breakfast items.

The morning of checkout at about 6am I woke up to a blaring fire alarm about 6 feet from my ear.  It gave me an instant headache and obviously woke up my wife and 2 year old son.  It stopped before we had time to get everything ready, so I called down to the front desk to ask about it.  They said it was a test!  They decided to test the #$@%ing fire alarm at 6am.

Pros:
1. Staff was nice. 
2. Restaurant was clean.
3. Crab cakes were decent.

Cons:
1. The pricing is reasonable on some things and insane on others. My parents had the king crab boil that was nearly $60. Utterly absurd considering how little food was included. 
2. 80% of what was served is premade, frozen items that the cooks just threw in the fryer. Jalepeño poppers, onion rings, fries, hush puppies, etc. Nothing was from scratch that we could tell. Sauces were all premade.
3. The kids meals were awful and overpriced. The fish sticks were not even grocery store quality. Obscure gray fish mash inside breading. Bleck. 
4. The service was pretty poor. She was trying really hard, which I appreciated. And we were one of maybe ten tables in the whole restaurant.

There was a gap in the rear passenger door handle that they were supposed to get looked at before delivery - they didn't. I had to bring it back 2 times for both these things.

That was 2 months ago still no call to bring it in to get it fixed. At Thanksgiving my wife and my 18 month old were driving 2 hours out of town and almost went off the road THREE TIMES because of how bad the tires were on the vehicle - the Tuesday after Thanksgiving I took it to a Tire shop to look for winter tires and the Tire Centre tells me my vehicle should have 20 inch tires on it but Sherwood Ford had replaced the 20"" wheels with 18"" wheels and crap tires - why would they do something like this...

What I got was an average burger patty with communion wafer of a flatbread bun. The bun was dry and cracked at the fold. I did like the flavor, but the texture completely ruined the bun for me. The meat itself a small patty cooked well but underseasoned. The veggies on the burger were suspect in freshness. I had ordered the cheddar cheeseburger. My two dining companions ordered the bacon cheeseburger and the Texas bbq burger. The Texas bbq guy said it was mediocre. The bacon cheeseburger guy said it was about the same as Carl's Jr. He might have been exaggerating.

The sauces were average at best, especially with all the hole in the wall burger joints that dominate the foodie scene. My dining companion did not care for the viscosity of the sauces, as they were too runny. I did not think the flavors were bold enough. 

The seasoning on the fries was pretty good, but the texture reminded me of kfc potato wedges.

Service was irritating. The cashier did not greet us but instead carried on a long conversation with other employees. The service when we received the food was better but not enough to make me forget the cashier.

My sister had stayed here once before and really enjoyed her stay so we decided that for the price we couldn't really pass it up. 4 people, 1 room, with parking, $200? Not bad. 

So the night before our trip my fiancé received an email allowing us to schedule our own check-in time, so we picked noon. 

We arrived in Philadelphia at 11:30 and tried to drive straight to our hotel. We tried multiple roads and realized all the blocked. Frustrated after trying to get to the hotel for half an hour I decided to call and ask for assistance. This is where things get interesting. We were told that since the construction was occurring if we wanted to check in we would have to ""figure it out ourselves"" and to ""find alternate parking."" That didn't sit well with me. We were already paying almost $40 for overnight parking, they shouldn't have disregarded us so easily like that. I was also told check-in was at 3pm regardless of what the email said. Not a great first impression. 

An hour or so later my fiancé received an email from Aja, an associate at The Windsor mentioned that they were trying to put a hold on his account but he recently had to get a new card so he emailed her the new number but we never received an email back confirming she got it. So half an hour later I asked him to call and see if she had gotten it, which she said she hadn't.  This was impossible but he once again gave her the number over the phone and we went on our way. 

A few hours later we arrived at the hotel. As we walk in to check-in the 2 front desk men gave us an unnerving look. Odd. My fiancé proceeded to check us in and the guy goes ""we were just about to cancel your reservation."" Um excuse me? What do you mean you were about to cancel our reservation? The card was once again declined because Aja, the baffoon, never updated the number! Not for nothing, maybe you should be checking that your coworker finish her job before you get nasty with people who are paying to stay there. 

The room was nice but I didn't like that there wasn't enough towels considering there were 4 people staying in the room. 

Now onto the horrid valet parking. Saturday night we had a dinner reservation for 8:45 that was 7 minutes away from the hotel. We arrived in the parking garage at 8:15 and asked for our car. It took 25 minutes for someone to bring our car around. Ridiculous. The next morning we called for our car and when we went downstairs the guys were still sitting around in the booth and no one had bothered to get the car. Save your $40 and find parking elsewhere. 

The room was nice but every associate other than housekeeping was very rude. 

Now here's the fun part, my fiancé got charged 3 separate prices and the hold on his account took 5 days to clear. Alan who works in the financial department was incompetent and I do believe Aja and the other rude front desk man made charges on our account because I called her out for being a moron. 

Never ever ever stay here. Everyone sucks, they're overpriced, and they'll charge you multiple times because they're idiots.",2014-11-18 00:20:47

He was pleasant enough and in the course of our conversation told me Dr Cohen did not retire but ""quit"" to go into the junk metal business.

She fired back that I had an attitude and to mind my business. Having paid her the $6 we decided to leave.

Housecrafters was the subcontractors for the kitchen and USIG was the subcontractors for the flooring. All of the subcontracting was by Home Depot. The initial ripout&nbsp; and disposal of the kitchen was completed in two days without any issues. Then floor had a solid subfloor. The flooring was&nbsp;one SQ foot tile.What happened is on the day the flooring guys were supposed to show up they came in looked at the floor and took off. As I was not home and a friend let them in I could not talk to them. My friend did give my number and tell them to call me. All they said was there was a issue and took off. It took two weeks of contstantly calling HD simply to find out what this "" issue "" was. No one called me back with this simple info. At this point I got a subfloor contractor to evaluate my subfloor though I had no idea what the ""issue "" was with it. He evaluated and said there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Two days later a USIG manager and HD regional manager show up and they come up with a price change of $ 2000 for 160 SQ FT. That is on top of the $ 2200 I had already paid. Granted two people from HD had come and inspected the whole kitchen on two differant times prior to the conract been given to HD. Obviously the floor was there when they came. After a back and forth I had to insist on a refund for the flooring and got a another vendor to put in the floor. They had no issues and placed the floor in 72 hrs. Granted by now the delay was going into 4 wks since ripout of kitchen. 

After five weeks housecrafters sent person to place cabinets. At this point it was discovered a wrong cabinet was ordered. Order was placed for new cabinet. Granite was then placed and one week later house crafters sent their person back to complete. It was then discovered that the order for the cabinet had actually not gone through. The worker came in for four hours and did some minor adjustment. I had to plead with him to place a water line to the refigerator which then he did. I asked him to place hardware on cabinets. He said it was frinday and his frame of mind was not there to place hardware as his train of thought was disrupted by the missing cabinet and the granite issue. He stated that the granite was too tight on stove and could not move it. So one week later granite people arrived and pulled the stove out without any issue and to make housecrafter happy they trimmed the granite. Then finally after about another&nbsp;3 wks the cabinet showed up. Finally housecrafters sent there man to complete the work. He did this over two days. The work is subpar at best. While this whole project was going on New appliances were delivered from lowes. the stove has been repeatedly damaged beyond use.

For this entire episode I was contstanly on the phone. I was insulted by the office worker at Housecrafters, repeatedly. My calls to HD were never returned. They acted like they were doing me a favor. Five months after the project was given to HD I have a subpar kitchen, destroyed stove ( no replacement in sight and unusable ) and project that would need a proffesional to come in and fix up. I do not step foot in HD after this. In my opinion keep whatever kitchen one has is better than doing bussiness with HD or housecrafters or USIG.

When I sat to dry everyone was pretty much leaving which was fine. But I think the woman that did mine should of stayed till her customer was done. She had the dryer on my toes, right before she left and then came to switch to put it on my nails. But before she did that, she touched my toe to see if it was dry and smeared it. Did she fix it? Nope she was more concerned about leaving. Since living in-the area for 11 years this is the worse place I have been to and will not be returning.",2018-09-03 14:49:28

My mom and I walk into this post office...it's the start of any great joke.
My brother-in-law, stationed at Spangdahlem Air Force Base in Germany, purchased a cuckoo clock for her birthday.
Yay.
You know, a gift that bugs you every hour. 
He ships and insures this package with the United States Post Office. $100 and some odd change for $500 insurance and shipping. 
Cool. He is a good kid.

Well the clock arrives and it looks as if Ndamukong Suh delivered it with a foot stomp to the fragile sticker. I guess it's what he does in the off season from the Lions. Foot stomp and elbow fragile packages. 
Ah but don't worry, and dry your aged eyes mom- it's insured.
So we walk into this post office on 22nd and Pantano, wait in line, get to the next available window and...wait for it...
The person that does the insurance claims is on vacation for two weeks. 
I have only ten days to make this claim because I needed receipts from Germany.
Are you serious? Only one person at this branch does the insurance claims?
Well there are other post offices you can go to sir.

First of all, I ordered a 6"" White cake, with Vanilla ButterCream frosting, and a Raspberry filling. I asked for roses and ""Happy Birthday"" as my message.
I picked it up and my birthday was the next day. When I opened the box with several friends, to my dismay it was a cake with whipped cream and not vanilla cream frosting. Who puts roses on whipped cream?
I was unable to go back to the bakery because of work so I called and I spoke with the lady who had taken my order. She told me that I had signed an agreement that I would return my cake within twenty four hours.
I was asked to sign a little piece of paper, at the time of my purchase but when I asked what I was signing, the associate told me that I must cancel my order within twenty four hours after ordering my cake. 
I told her that I do not like whipped cream on my birthday cake and I did not order the whipped cream.
She placed me on hold for the next eight minutes and I hung up and called back. 
I called back a total of five times and each time they placed my call on hold.
Finally, I called back and asked to speak to to the manager. This person told me that she was the manager and she was very rude to me. She said that I had signed their agreement to return anything that I had ordered within twenty four hours. My birthday wasn't until three days after I had placed my order and another and one day after I had picked it up.
I celebrated my birthday in the evening and the bakery was already closed.
I asked the manager for a copy of the ""agreement"" and she said ""I am not going to give you anything!"" She hung up on me!
My birthday was a disaster because of their own employee who had taken my order down wrong. I contacted my bank to object to being charged for $31 and the Bank of America is in the process of investigating this.
I also went back to the bakery and gave an employee of Josef's Vienna Bakery my cake after she told me that they had refunded my money.
It has been about six weeks later and no refund and yet they have my money and my cake.
No consumer should ever be treated so unfairly as I have been.
The proprietors have also been advised by a certified letter that I sent to them. Very poor customer service to say the least. 
I will be pursuing my claim with the BoA credit Debit Card purchase and since their employee did take possession of my cake as well as misinform me about being refunded my money, I feel that it is only right for me to file a ""Civil Suit in Small Claims Court at Reno Justice Court."" Hopefully this will prevent these people from taking advantage of their consumers.",2021-03-22 21:45:54

I also asked why it would take three days to receive a call back and only mere days before the Easter brunch for which I was booking? And I then asked what reasonable place has availability just a few days ahead of Easter? The answer to all these questions was I do not know.

Let me start the review by recounting the two unacceptable experiences I had at Kitchen Bar. 

First, at lunch I ordered nachos, and the cheese on the nachos came out with mold on it. There is just no excuse for this, and when I complained and showed the mold to the server, they refused to comp the nachos. I had to argue with a manager to get them to nix the nachos from the bill. 

Second, I ordered a burger, and there was hair in my fries. This one is unacceptable, but not as bad as the moldy nachos. I requested a new plate and was provided with one. 

Breakfast: 

I've always enjoyed the breakfast, I feel the quality of the food is at its peak during the weekend morning rush. 

Lunch & Dinner: 

Aforementioned issues occurred at lunch and dinner. The food quality is at its lowest during these times. I would never eat at Kitchen Bar during these times again. 

Nightlife: 

The music is way too loud. Despite being close to a college campus, the average age of the person going to Kitchen Bar at night is over 40. If that's your demographic great, you may enjoy yourself. If not, there are better bars with cheaper drink prices and less ostentatious DJ's to satisfy your nightlife experience.",2011-07-12 14:20:58

My husband and I came to Bucatini's with my son and his family (wife and 2 children) after they had had a tremendously busy day at an event and were beat tired and looking forward to relaxing with their family. First off, the sun was setting and it was right in my son's face. We asked the waiter if he could extend the awning a bit. He said it was out all the way....after ""dealing with it"" for a while we asked the busboy (wish I had remembered his name) who then left to get the crank and extended the awning. Dinner was okay, but something happened to the calzoni so everyone got their food except my grandson..it was nice of them to be apologetic and bring out a bruschetta to tide him over while they made another. When they finally brought his calzoni it was dark crust not a golden brown...but it tasted good he said.

We weren't especially impressed with the waiter to begin with and wanted to tip our busboy because he was very helpful and efficient. The kicker is that when my son paid the bill he ended up tipping the TOTAL which had already had the TIP INCLUDED. SO NOT ONLY DID HE TIP 20% ON THE FOOD AND WINE BUT ON THE AUTOMATIC 18% GRATUITY THEY HAD ADDED! We have never heard of a restaurant charging an automatic gratuity for 6 people.

When we got in the car I was surprised at how much the bill was and then we realized our mistake after adding up the costs. He felt embarrassed and realized he should have checked the bill but we were already heading home after a long day. Seems other people ie. Liat S. 8/25/13 have had the same problem. In my opinion this is a scam and I won't be going back. This left a bad taste in our mouths!",2014-07-08 04:26:29

So...although I like the concept of the store, the amazingly convenient location and the large selection of organic products, 5 months in I am really unimpressed, mainly in 2 areas - customer service and produce (and sometimes they overlap!) I don't know what the deal is with the produce but it's often mouldy, slimy or close to the expiry date. Last week it was mini cucumbers and lettuce, today every single bunch of cilantro had slime on it...EVERY BUNCH!  Same thing with their packaged salads, when you buy a clamshell of lettuce there's a 50/50 chance that it will be bad even though the expiry date is 5 days away and you'll then either have to suck up the $8 you just spent or go back to the store and try to argue why you should be able to at least get an exchange without your receipt, after all it's THEIR store brand, PC Organics!  I can't count the number of times I've stood alone at the cheese counter waiting for employees to stop chatting and notice me, that gets old.

Today was the last straw.  For months I've been overcharged on microwave popcorn, the shelf price says $3.99 but it scans at $4.59.  Usually by the time I realize it I'm already home, in my PJs and getting ready to scarf down aforementioned delicious popcorn and can't be bothered to go back and haggle over 60 cents.  Today was different!  I marched up to customer service full of righteous indignation (not really, I'm pretty polite lol) and spent several minutes deflating as I waited for someone to actually notice me.  When the sales clerk finally came over from wherever she was I proudly showed her my receipt and explained the ongoing problem.  She asked me to show her where this lying popcorn lived so I took her over to the aisle and there it was, $3.99.  She took the shelf price tag off the shelf and walked away without a word or a look back.  I feebly called out ""So...is that it then?""  Yep, yes it was.  No ""honour the shelf price, customer is always right, give the lady her 60 cent refund"" for this girl.  I went for a Booster Juice and planned my return to Safeway.

I came to Nashville to visit a friend who just found out he has cancer. When asked where he and his family (they have twin babies) wanted to go to dinner, they suggested The Pharmacy. Knowing it was popular, we called ahead to find the wait time. We were told to download an app to add ourselves to a wait list, which we did. After adding ourselves to the list, we saw it would be an hour wait time, which was fine. We went to a park and let the kids run some energy out before returning to the restaurant. 

When we arrived at the time specified by the app, we were told it would only be 15 minutes more wait time. Fine, we waited. (Nevermind that standing and holding a baby for a long time was painful for my friend, whose kidney burst a week ago due to the cancer growth.) When we asked again, 15 minutes later, they gave us the same wait time. When we asked a third time, they told us 30 minutes. It's one thing to expect to wait for dinner; it's another to be strung along. 

By the time we were seated, in total 2 hours later than when we first set off for dinner, the babies were overtired and screaming, and we were starving and frustrated. To add to this, the food was incredibly disappointing. The pharmacy burger I had was dry and flavorless. The tater tots were good, but honestly, how do you mess up tater tots?

This place was no exception. However I wonder if I am partly to blame for not following intuition. When I called and scheduled the girl I spoke to was not friendly at all. I was then given instructions to arrive 10 minutes before my 830 appointment time. 

I had to call then back later that day when I realized I was double booked. The girl I spoke with just TOLD ME she would cancel my appointment. She did not offer a later time, suggest switching something... You know like actually providing customer service which I thought was her job. That was the second time I thought, ""this is a bad idea."" 

Third bad idea confirmation: outside on the parking lot at 8:19, I receive a phone inquiring if I would still be making my 8:30 appointment. To which I replied, ""It's 8:19 and I am to be there at 8:20."" And this rude person actually decided to argue with me. She got smart with me and said ""Um no. You're new and you needed to be here at 8. 30 minutes before your appointment time to fill out paperwork."" I ... AM ... FLOORED. Her tone and response was all wrong. 

When I arrived the same smart ass decided to painstakingly retrieve my paperwork as so to reiterate the point that it takes 30 minutes to complete ""paperwork."" I work for surgeons and funny it doesn't take our patients that long to sign consents to be sliced open. But then again MassageEnvy is doing a greater work. 

In case you wanna know.. Took me all of 5 min to complete their highly important forms. 

Fourth bad idea confirmation:  the masseuse although I reiterated that I didn't want to be bear handled, did in fact bear handle me. I am so stiff it's ridiculous. And to add insult to injury. (Yes. I literally feel injured) SHE KEPT TRYING TO TALK TO ME!!!! WTF!!! I had my ear buds in and I thought that was the universal STFU sign! Apparently not to her. Then ... The facial. What a complete cluster. This girl slathered on layer after layer of goop. And she KEPT using the words ""free radicals"". Before every application of glob she would say ""prevents free radicals and locks in moisture."" I was horrified at the amount of product used during one facial just to plug it to later try and sell. Before hand she already complimented me on ""perfect skin"" and in the ""holy paperwork"" I indicated I did not have skin issues, and I verbalized to her that I have a low maintenance skin care routine and I have sensitive skin. At one point I asked her how much longer it would be because I actually felt myself becoming angry at this ludicrous ""facial"". 
The next outrage is that she actually got cream in my hair! My stylist had just colored and conditioned my hair! And before the facial was over my skin was itching and burning. And after this hour long facial and all the globs of product applied not a single layer of anything was applied to my lips. I was expecting a almond & honey or sugar exfoliation. There was none! 


At check out I was fuming. I had to ward off being offered to buy extra junk and all I wanted to do was rush home and shower. When the check out girl who was the same rude check in girl asked me loudly and what about the tip I was outraged. I said no thank you and then she asks loudly ""so did you take care of that in the room?"" I asked her to bill the card on file for my services and she clicked a button and said ""good bye"".

For the last several years, for me, it has been hit and miss. Last evening I had dinner there with two friends. My friends each ordered a small fillet. I ordered the larger, 8 ounce filet. When the steaks arrived, the two petite filet's were significantly larger than mine. I pointed this out to the gentleman who brought our food, who wasn't our server. He said theirs were larger because bacon was wrapped around them. I asked him if being wrapped in bacon made their steaks nearly twice as thick and at least as big around as mine? He turned around and walked off. Shortly after, our server came by, and I voiced the same concern. He came back, said he had spoken with the manager, and that it was ""taken care of""(???). He did not offer me an 8 ounce steak as I had ordered, nor did he offer to bring me bacon to wrap around my little petite fillet. When the bill arrived, I found out what he meant. Taking ""care of it"", meant they charged me for the smaller steak, which is exactly what they delivered, MINUS the bacon. It's a shame they went to these EXTREME measures to try to make things right, and yes, I'm being a smart-aleck.....

It wasn't ""taken care of"". I didn't want a puny little steak, smaller than the other petite size steaks. I didn't enjoy the evening, and it was a waste of money.

uagO33Z-JecIg8FjamL98A,CV5a77ia0qTo2xDoamChGA,KPaXKXjlUK5EUeKP7xbAsA,2.0,3,0,1,"The apartments are beautiful, there is no doubt about that. The interior including the kitchen and bathroom are modern, the washer and dryer are wonderful, and all the other amenities are top notch including pool, gym etc. I think everything is kept fairly clean. I enjoy the ""pool parties"". And the location is fantastic.

However, looks aren't everything..
Parking is expensive. I park in the underground garage. 
The heater in my apartment was on every hour of every day for the winter. It does not heat up the apartment very efficiently. Worse than any apartment I've ever lived in, including in Chicago where there are icy winters. And of course, that really boosts your energy costs.
The A/C has broken multiple times. They do repair it fairly quickly, usually by the next day.
I can't take a hot bath. The hot water runs out when the tub fills about 1/4. Also never experienced this in all of my 10 prior apartments. 
The ceiling in my apartment leaks water when it rains. Each time I call the repair team, they ""fix"" it. And it works most of the time, but I've had about 4 leaks this year. Luckily I don't have valuable furniture in my apartment.
The Luxe package system is god awful. I know a package has been delivered because I receive the delivery email from Amazon etc, yet it doesn't show up in the Luxe system. The guy who operates it doesn't give a shit, so he shows up late in the mornings and leaves like 5 minutes early at night.. you would think this system would be great for people who work all day, but in reality it works 50% of the time and the remainder of the time it's just damn frustrating.
I've called the front desk multiple times during business hours without an answer. How are they not answering their phones during work? 
The bike room is chock full of bikes. I cannot even maneuver in there and I'm not that large.
A ton of construction in the area.. which I don't mind, but it does cause some inconvenience.

All of the above make the hefty price tag associated with the apartment seem outrageous. This is the most I've ever spent on an apartment, and the basic amenities that we take for granted (hot water, warmth in winter, cool in summer, receiving packages in a timely manner, no rain water inside) are not adequately addressed. I have lived in comparatively hideous apartments where at least I had warmth and comfort. I expect from a luxury apartment, one of the most expensive in the city, that these issues are the number one concern of the management and facility. Instead they bolster up the pool area and grill and gym, which look nice from the outside, but they don't justify the cost of the apartment if basic needs aren't met.",2016-06-07 15:17:28

As he traveled, he sought not only to expand the reaches of the great country for which he explored, but also sought to experience the culinary adventures that lay along that winding river.

From the smoky rubbed ribs of Memphis to the spicy flair of Cajun in New Orleans, one can imagine that his palates was ever satisfied. However... every great journey is fraught with peril, and Landry's Seafood house in St. Louis is one of the greatest dangers along the path.

As we entered the gaudy restaurant with green carpeted floors straight out of 1974, we were greeted with a waitress who was sure to inform us of her duty to provide for her children by providing us with excellent service, but oh, dear reader, those children must starve for excellent service was not on the menu.

After a slow start with the appetizers, honestly not bad, we waited another 20 minutes for our wet salads to be brought. Perhaps they had just washed them but, more likely, they had just pulled them from the nearby river! The supposedly accompanying bread never made it to the table. 

Following the abysmal starters were the entrees. One would think that for a seafood restaurant along a river which the feeds into a gulf they supposedly source from that the would at least attempt an effort to place fresh fish upon the table. They didn't. 

The shrimp was over cooked, the stuffed crab burnt black, the lobster so rubbery steak knives could not pierce its flash, and the fries devoid of an semblance of flavor from being under a heat lamp so long. While the server apologized profusely for the food, and her lack of memory regarding drink orders, the manager comped the half of our table which sent the food back.

If you make the journey to St. Louis, make sure to hire a trail guide to lead you far from this paltry chain. In short, avoid at all costs!

Correct me if I'm wrong here, Yelpers, but the calling the service provider first before posting a bad review is not how review sites like Yelp work. They work by providing honest reviews of businesses and service providers so that consumers can make informed decisions about where they spend their money. Many smart service providers, when given a poor review, see that as an opportunity to become better businesses by resolving the issue -- not by personally attacking the customer providing the honest review. Second, if a service provider is unable to handle a certain level of workload due to ongoing health issues, I would advise that service provider to avoid taking on on new clients and then flaking on them consistently.",2020-11-19 21:40:35

The venue is beautiful, but the service DOES NOT MATCH!

First off, the host at the front desk was not very inviting. We stood in front of the host and waited to be greeted as she spoke to another colleague.

As per request, we were seated outside. Shortly after being seated down, a server began bickering with the host about our seating arrangements due to impending rain... (understandable however arguing in front of guest makes the place unorganized.) We are then relocated to the interior hall of the venue.

OKAY FINE....we sit inside.

Once seated inside, who we thought was our server, filled our glasses with water and we proceeded to order an apple juice. The assumed server then asked who our server was and she then left..(what??). ""We're not sure"".

Being that is was buffet style food selection, we got up to get our food. New to the New Orleans culture and food selection we asked a few servers for their input on some recommendations of their best dish. The feedback was not informative as they just leaned against the wall and nonchalantly shrugged, with no answer..(Right...WOW).

While seated with our food at the table, the food runner asked once again asked us who our server was.  Finally our server arrives at our table 15 minutes later to ask, only to be asked if we ""Can you pick up your plates and move to the next table for the live band?"" I was taken aback by the request due to the disorganization. Then we were then told to NOT move.

Leaving dirty plates in the middle of the table, our server NEVER came back to check on us, let alone bring the drinks we ordered 45 mins PRIOR with the food runner. Nor did she EVER ask about it.

The food runner then walks passed and REALIZES the drinks never arrived and apologized. We kindly declined the drinks at that point and was OVER IT!

When our server brings the bill, she doesn't even say ""Thank you for dining"", she just dropped the bill and walked away.

As we leave, OF COURSE the host does not send us off with smile. 

Overall, the food I would give a 3.5, BUT THE SERVICE...WAS HORRIBLE.

Didn't see a manager, didn't feel welcomed and that definitely affected how we enjoyed the food.

pb6H16xyY2x3NrkXImQtFw,6rJjATh4EMmvR1IC4BNjAw,xus8lfvQNIjSrMnPw3mBoA,1.0,0,0,0,"So back in June I purchased a groupon for this salon. The groupon was $65 for a haircut, style, blowdry, & full highlights. Groupon had a similar groupon months beforehand that I believe was $59 for the same services. I used that groupon in May & asked to switch the haircut for a touch up color. I noticed there was a difference of plus $10 in price based on the salon's regular prices. When I asked to switch it out with staff when making the appointment, it wasn't a problem. I was never asked nor charged the additional $10. I tipped exceptionally well because of this.

I arrive for my appointment today & ask the girl at the desk if it's okay to switch out the haircut for a touch up & she says ""oh, yeah, that's not a problem"". I go to get my hair done with the same girl as last time & she asks whether I want a blow dry & I said it's included in the groupon. 

The girl says that when they switch out the haircut, it doesn't include the blow dry & then says she will go check. She doesn't come back for at least 10 minutes. I'm not pleased already. The owner comes up to me, never introduces himself (I had to ask the girl later who he was) & says he can't switch out the service. I tell him I was told it wasn't a problem. He asks who I talked to. When I don't know the name (btw, the girl doing my hair was really familiar with switching out services considering that she wanted to charge me for a service that was already included in the groupon), he said that he would honor that if I could give him the name. He was extremely rude to me during this exchange & I wanted to walk out. I had to argue with him about it for about 5 minutes.

He says it will be an additional $65 to get the touch up & he can't make exchanges. I told him that he should honor what I was told. He says ""So, my options are, I can get groupon to refund your $65 or I can give you what you want."" I had already told this guy during this exchange that the price difference between a haircut & a touch up is $10 & I would gladly pay the additional $10 to switch out the service.

I really wanted to walk out but the problem is I don't think he's right that I could get my money back from groupon. He did say something I didn't know that apparently he doesn't get paid the $65 unless I use the groupon. But, I'm fairly certain I can't get my money back from groupon because, yes, technically speaking he doesn't have to switch out services so if I don't use it as stated, I am SOL. That being said, when all of his staff has said it's not a problem then he should honor that.

So finally I said I wouldn't pay the additional $65 & he said that he would agree to switch out the service because ""it's good customer service"". & I said really just not knowing what to say after being treated like that ""well, your staff did tell me it wouldn't a problem."" He said ""Did you hear what I said?"" which was like saying to me ""shut up & be grateful, lady"".

Let me explain something else. This guy was full Jersey Italian man's man guy & the salon was empty except for the girls who worked for him & one customer (btw, no other customers came in the whole time I was there).

So then I figure the girl is going to be very nice to me because she knows I'm paying her tip. Nope. She at first apologizes but goes on about how she just wishes she knew who I talked to (this is the same girl that said it would be $35 to blow dry my hair when I got there even though, again, blow dry is clearly included in the groupon so, again, clearly she was familiar with switching out the haircut for a touch up). Then she barely talked to me the whole time. After a while of no talking, I asked if it was always this dead on Sundays (at this point, I WAS the only customer there) & she did say then something about how no salons were open on Sundays so the word hadn't gotten out (okay).

Again, she barely talked the whole time & actually didn't even really ask me what I wanted other than ""are you happy with the color at the ends?"" & my hair did turn out darker than I usually get it & prefer.

Then after she washes my hair she asks if I want to upgrade to the blow dry. I actually thought that was included as the owner just said he would switch out services but had been thinking the whole time I just wanted to leave as soon as possible because it didn't matter if she blew it out, they wouldn't fix if anything was wrong... so I said ""no"". She said that we were done so I went up the front, grabbed the groupon which they had left by me at a chair, & asked the girl at the front for a receipt. My receipt, btw, was for $59 not the $65 I paid. That's okay because I was going to call groupon about it anyway.",2012-11-11 21:13:41

I should start by saying that I've been a client at this salon for a few years. The atmosphere is off-putting from the moment you walk in. Honestly, the only people who ever smile at me at this place are the valet guys. Everyone acts as if you're inconveniencing them by being there. But I've put up with it because I had gift cards to spend. But after my last experience here, I will NEVER go back. 

I tried to make an appointment for highlights with the stylist I saw at my last appointment, but she was unavailable. The receptionist set me up with Apple, a stylist who she said was at the same level. Same level should equal same result, right? Nope. When I sat down, I told Apple that I wanted to do the exact same thing I did last time with a little more blonde mixed in. This salon puts all your information into a computer system, so they're supposed to know exactly what colors you received at your last appointment. I told Apple I get my hair done 2-3 times a year, so I like to keep my highlights very blended and natural. I don't want streaks or stripes. I've gotten my hair highlighted at least 20 times since I was a teenager, so I've learned exactly what to say to get the result I want. 

My appointment was at 12:15. Apple had only been working on my hair for about 15 minutes when another client came in. Apple kept going back and forth between us- it made me really uncomfortable. I know that many stylists will start on other clients while waiting for color to process, but this was ridiculous. This woman had an appointment scheduled 15 minutes after mine started. Who does that???

But the very worst thing about this experience was the result. I've attached the photos here. When it was blown dry and styled, it looked fine. Maybe a little too bright, but I figured it would fade a bit after the first few washes. When I got home to Baton Rouge and parted my hair normally, I was shocked. It got worse when I washed it. After using the same shampoo I've used on my highlights for several years, parts of it turned bright orange. The orange, yellow and white streaks made it even more obvious that the whole thing was a streaky mess. As you can see in the pictures, there are huge chunks of color, little tiny stripes and big pieces of hair that have no color at all. I have never done this, but I knew I would need to get this fixed, so I called for the manager and asked for a refund. She did offer to have my come back to the salon, but I live in Baton Rouge and was only in Metairie for the weekend. Plus- if this is what they think looks good, I really don't trust those people to touch my head again. So the manager agreed to refund my money. The entire amount was $152 and I tipped $25. I asked to put the tip on my card and the receptionist handed me cash. Since I paid $100 using a gift card, the manager put that amount back on a card. She has only refunded me for $52 because since they gave me cash, she can't prove that I actually tipped that amount. Honestly, it's not even worth it to me to argue. I just want to be done with this place. 

I ended up going to a salon in Baton Rouge and paying $250 to have it fixed. That result is also in a picture here. It looks a thousand times better, but my hair is fried from having so much done to it in one week. I've been growing it out for more than a year, but now I'll probably have to cut a few inches off because I have so much damage and breakage. Getting it fixed, plus all the deep conditioning, oils and products I've had to buy, has cost me more than $300. An expensive mistake on my part, I will not be returning to this place.

I still have $100 on a gift card here- I guess I'll give it to someone to get a massage or something and hope they get treated a little better.",2017-01-21 04:40:34

Since then, in 2020, my experiences with the bartenders have been nothing short of horrific.

The simplest of questions about their current beer lineups and beer styles typically generates a ""deer-in-headlights"" reaction from them. And it's been from several different bartenders.

I ordered the steak CHEESEburger with cheese which of course came out without cheese. Ordered a quesadilla which was literally bread and chicken with a sprinkle of cheese, and essentially fridge cold chicken tenders and fries... FINE. 

But what made this place exceptionally bad? The service. Our waitress started the day before (poor planning on managements part), so cut her slack right? Of course!

Don't take your prescription medicine(?) right in the open in the middle of giving us our food without washing hands in between. 3. Don't overcharge on a bill to give yourself a 20+% tip.

I took a bite of the second dumpling and it was still cold, so I spit it out and found RAW SHRIMP inside my dumpling. I immediately went to get the waitress attention and she apologized and took the dumpling back to the kitchen. I was very upset that my dumpling was RAW SHRIMP and little sign of scallop in it. She came back and gave me a new plate of ""scallop dumpling""and apologized. I was very skeptical so I checked the dumpling before I put it in my mouth. What a surprise!!!  The dumpling was filled with RAW SHRIMP again, even though the dumpling was still steamy. I lost my appetite and just wanted my check and a box to put my Sui mai in. She came back and took my ""scallop dumpling"" to put in the box. I told her that dumpling still have RAW SHRIMP.

I typically do most of my shopping at whole foods and I was looking forward to having an alternative.  Unfortunately Rastelli's has falling short.  
BEWARE when buying there I have been wrongly charged NUMEROUS times at the register, in the bakery, in seafood and the cheese department!  Which is the start to my complaint of the service.  
Meat and deli-quality of product is very good! Although, The service in the meat and deli is horrible. There has been numerous occasions when I had to wait until personnel finished their personal conversation prior someone helping me.  the deli department has some training issue I bought a Spanish ham $99.00 per lb)  for a charcuterie plate that wasn't separated after being cut so I ended with a pile of meat. For the same plate the next ham ($24.99 per lb) was cut to thick.   There is only one person that can properly cut lox.  My point is if you are going to carry high end product your staff has to be trained to know how to prepare and package it correctly.  
Cheese-excellent selection best in South jersey. But service again is inexperienced. I was grossly over charged and didn't realize it until minutes before serving the cheese.  I bought 2 cheeses (one $14.99 per lb the other $19.99 per lb) the girl never changed the code when weighing the other cheese so I was charged $19.99 for both.
Prepared foods- Rastelli's needs to hire a new chef.  The store is set up to have this amazing prepared food section however the prepared foods are terrible.   This is the biggest disappointment!
Seafood- I haven't bought fish there as it looks like fish in shop rite. I did buy shrimp that was labeled 16/20 however when I got it home there was 46 shrimp in my pound.  When I asked the fishmonger if he could clean it he looked at me as If I had three heads. 
Produce-I totally agree with previous reviewers it's bad no selection and the produce does not look fresh.
Bakery- the bakery is good (many products from classic cake) however there isn't much of a selection.
I suggest that Rastelli's needs to regroup and decide what they want to be!  Your prices are too high to be shop rite but your quality and service is not Zagaras or Whole foods!",2014-11-29 12:23:41

A group of us made reservations to dine at this restaurant on Sunday morning for brunch. The first couple arrived and was told that there was no champagne left for Sunday brunch mimosas (at 11:00am), but they could buy a $55.00 bottle of champagne if they so chose. Further, the server stated that they would not get more champagne as it would not be cost effective for them- the restaurant. I was shocked to hear this from a restaurant at any time, let alone these economic times. I arrived last in the party as I was parking. I was never offered a menu, never offered water and was basically ignored for not having arrived with the rest. The server finally offered to take a drink order from me. She returned with their ""Special House Bloody Mary,"" which basically was a standard bloody Mary mix with an unreasonable amount of horseradish and Worcestershire sauce in the bottom. In short, my lips were numb from the drink. 
After an hour and 15 minutes, our breakfasts came out in three groupings, as the one end of the table began eating 10 minutes before the rest of the table.

Rather than informing me that there was an open house for the property the next day, they forwarded my call to the point of contact for the property who had already left for the day. So I left a voicemail which was never ever returned. Ever.

They had listed this property all week at $1150/mo, which drew in 30 people to the open house on Saturday, then two days later on Monday changed the price to $1295/mo with only a ""whoops, we're sorry, we made a mistake in the listing price."" Classic bait and switch. Does anyone REALLY believe they didn't notice the ""mistake"" all week, including during discussions with 30 people at the open house? Very unclassy.

When my wife called on Monday, the point of contact for the property was out of the office that day, so finally the person answering the phone actually gave us some information, telling us that she couldn't forward an application unless we first viewed the property. At this point we were still unaware that the opportunity to see the property had been two days prior during Saturday's open house. We had to wait until the following day to call back to see if we could see the property.

We called back on Tuesday and talked to the point of contact for the property, who told us an application had already been accepted, and informed us of the open house that had occurred three days prior. Had we been aware, we would have been the first ones in line at the open house. But we were not given a chance. My call was not returned.

I was looking for a nail place to replace the one in California and because the reviews on Yelp were great on this place I decided to give it a try. I was very lucky to get matched with a girl named Cindy, she did an excellent job putting stiletto acrylics on. I never had them before so I was very excited. I spent $65 that first time. But because she did such a good job I didn't mind. I came back for a filling and once again it was great (with Cindy). Funny tho, a friend of mine did not have the same experience. She hated her nails when she went there (she got the same style nails I did by a different person). Her fingers looked so fat and weird do to so much acrylic placed on her nails. Since my experience was much different, I thought I had found my nail place here in Tucson. BOY WAS I WRONG!!

It was time for me to take my nails off, I wanted to go back to a regular mani. I called to ask how much would it cost to take them off and if Cindy was available. Guy on the phone said she was off and it would be $10! IF I wasn't getting anything else done. I told him that I was a regular and that I needed them off and I would make an appointment with Cindy as soon as I had time (which it was true btw). He insisted that it was $10 to take them off and $14 for a regular mani. So I said, the heck, I will pay the extra money and get the mani. I mean, it was just a regular mani, how bad can someone mess that up, right?.....

Right away I told the lady I just wanted them off and a regular mani. They honestly all looked at me as if I was a peasant. That is the best way to describe it, because i was spending less than $16. But they didn't mind when I paid the $65 the first time and the $30 something the second time, right?!

Anyways, this is when things got interesting. First thing she does is cut the length of my pinky long acrylic nail, straight up. She cut so damn close that she cut my skin and part of MY nail. Right away my nail started bleeding and she freaked out (mean while clients continued to arrive). She then told me to leave my pinky out while I would soak my other fingers on acetone for a ""bit"". The manager (the lady that greets you) came over to take a look at my pinky and she tried to pull my hanging nail off! So i moved it away and I said it hurt, so she goes ""ohhhhh is because she cut your skin off. Don't worry. I will fix it for you. She will finish the rest"". That was the last time I saw that lady. In the mean time the original lady sat down  to do someone else's pedicure. So I am sitting there, waiting, with my nails submerged on acetone, for over 15 mins. I kept taking my fingers out of the acetone because they started to hurt. 

At this point I was pissed, so I told her lady that I had to work at 5pm (I arrived at 3:30). She came back and tried to lift off the acrylic nails with another acrylic nail, if that make sense. Since it was not working out, she just decided to use the little sanding machine to take them off. She only took off some of the acrylic, leaving bits and pieces behind on my nails. She was a hot mess. 

Finally, she goes ""I am going to leave your pinky the way it is (meaning with a big fat piece of acrylic and blood on it. Oh yeah, and a piece of my nail missing) let it grow and next time I will fix it"". I gave her this weird look thinking ""ohhhh so you mean when I pay again for this, although I am paying for it NOW"". I just yanked the hanging nail myself and she just pained over it. 

I just wanted to get the heck out of there and never come back. I paid $19 freaking dollars for this experience. My nails look horrible. Chucks of acrylic still on my nails, painted over and one big fat pinky. 

Honestly, stay away from this place. It's horrible. Management is horrible and rude as well. No sense of costumer service. I am not trying to sound as if I waned them to deliver the sun and the stars to me. Just to do their job, a service that they are providing.

I called the office and they told me they would tell the driver to stop by. 35 minutes later I was finally in their office. The next strike came when the Mercedes I had reserved was not available, which I kind of figured might happen, but then they upgraded me to a Volvo SUV. One day later I am 15 minutes from attending a wedding when the Volvo just stops dead. There was no way to restart the car due to the fancy keyless ignition so I called the built in SOS service. They could not help me so I called the rental office. They could not help me either and I was redirected to the corporate office where the agent told me that they were having trouble with this car due to flooding and raining. She also told me that it would be 7 to 10 hours to get my car towed and another one brought in to replace it. I was also informed that I did not have roadside assistance and there might be an extra charge. The roadside assistance program doesn't mention if the car actually quits working, it only mentions if you get locked out or need a key replaced etc. I would call that strike three. It is now three hours later and I still don't know what is going to happen with a replacement car, I have left the rental car in a parking lot and I'm waiting for the tow guys to call,  and I hope I can actually make it back to the airport by Monday. I will finish this review when I find out how much this actually will cost me. Zero stars for now. 
I just had a new vehicle delivered to me approximately 22 hours after breaking down. It is the same Volvo so I am slightly anxious that this car will actually get me to the airport tomorrow. Not to jinx anything but I will leave it where it is for the evening. Michelle from Sixt company was very helpful on the phone and more reassuring than anyone else I had talked to. She even checked in with me when the car was . I still don't know what the final bill will be but the contract delivered with the new car has the same price as the old contract.

""I am not a fan of war history museums that do not show clear reasons why these machines were built and what may have been the consequences.  It does not teach the consequences of wars, which I think many museums in the United States need to do.""

This young man is clearly a product of our public school system. His ignorance of history and American civics is beyond belief. Yes, wars are horrible. But as long as despots exist, wars will exist. And the country or countries being attacked have every right to defend themselves.

Tens of millions of American men & women have defended our nation, wearing a Navy, Marine Corps, Army, Air Force or Coast Guard uniform. Millions have died or been wounded while wearing that uniform. Their sacrifices provide the liberty for Precious Snowflakes like Jonathan B to make idiotic statements like the one above.

As for myself, I am looking forward to my visit to this museum and I will be truly thankful for the opportunity to see the results of American ingenuity and bravery.",2016-04-28 17:24:19

If you're looking for a wedding venue, do not go to the Sam Davis Home. 
For one, the ""management"" or ""event coordinators"" told us one thing and our contract stated different things. The original coordinator told us he would provide cleaning tools and trash bags for the night after the wedding. 
When we asked the people in the office for trash bags they said we were supposed to provide them. (Which isn't a big deal to provide our own trash bags but we were just told differently from the beginning). 
You pay a deposit of $500 and you receive your deposit back if you follow the guidelines. Which is also understandable. But one of the reasons we didn't get the deposit back is because the chairs weren't positioned correctly. And when we cleaned up the extra chairs and tables and put them in the Creek House, those weren't put in the correct location of the house. Which we stacked up nice and neatly. A table was left open, only because it was open when we arrived there. 
The trash cans were full and we were told we would have help by the original coordinator with taking the trash out. 
All I'm saying is, if you plan on having your wedding there, don't expect to get your deposit back because you MUST have everything PERFECT, and in the correct locations without having a sign saying where they MUST go.

From the time I walked in I should have know that this was not going to go good because the man and woman that greeted me were really dismissive when I walked in.  They made me stand there with my 2 8lb dogs and wait for a long time before even talking to me!  Kind of like I was bothering them.  Also the place smelled really gross like a dirty, wet dog smell....guess the air conditioner doesn't work well here. 

We have 2 little LhasaPoo dogs that I specifically asked to have cut into a ""Teddy Bear"" style.  It is a very common style for little fluffy dogs.  I went over what I was expecting...round face, rounded legs, nails, clipped, shorter hair on body...etc.  They told me...""Oh No Problem""...(please note that I never mentioned the word ""SHAVED""}  I took them in at 8:00a and they said they would have them done by Noon at the latest.  There were 3 more dogs that came in behind me at the same time, so I should have known.  I called them at noon to see if they were done yet and they said they were running behind and would call me when they were ready. Called again at 2:30p...still not done...so needless to say they did not have them done until nearly 5pm!  I was so upset...my dogs have never had to be at any groomer for 8 hours!  But the worst was yet to come!

They finally called me.  When I walked in I didn't ever recognize my pups because they had completely SHAVED off all of their hair....their face, their ears, their body and their tails!!!!!  I was in shock and so upset.  I asked them why they had done this....they said they had some matting, which was BS because I had completely brushed them out, tangle free, before I brought them!

What happened was they had too many dogs and by the time they got to my dogs they just took the razor to them all over their entire body.  They looked horrible.  I was in such shock I just paid and left.  When I got home my husband was livid.  He went back over there with the dogs and encountered the rude German accented lady and another lady that said she was the owner.  They told him that we didn't take care of our dogs!  They tried to give him some fur to show him that our dogs were matted but they gave him fur that was brown/tan...our dogs are white and black!!!  It has taken over 9 months for our dogs fur to grow back out!  

It sounds a little weird but we could tell the dogs did not like this experience either.  They acted really weird and sad for a good few days afterwards.  It still makes me upset to think about it!

Overall the customer service at this location has consistently declined over the last few years. 
Furthermore, for all the Indy locations that had a remodel, the checkout lines are terrible and you can barely if at all get two people through at a time because the checkout isle is so narrow you have to wait for register 2 to be done ringing the customer up before you can get to register 1.

I normally don't go to the food trucks at work but I decided to give this one a shot because I thought this food truck was from a previously bookmarked brick n mortar restaurant by the same name ""Aloha To Go"" I confirmed with the guy cooking in the food truck it is not not associated with that restaurant location. It is different. He gave me a card when I asked if he had a restaurant location that said ""Brewer's tasting room."" I guess that's where there food truck is posted when they're not traveling.

I wanted to get a taste of everything so I got the Big Kahuana sampler  for 12 dollars. The sampler came with shoyu chicken, Kalua pork and teriyaki beef, along with two scoops of sticky rice, macoroni salad  and pineapple slaw. The chicken looked and tasted as if it was  baked with barely any seasoning then pulled. My two other coworkers who got the tacos and big kahuana sampler concurred about the chicken- no flavor.  I usually like dark meat but the taste of the dark pieces of the chicken was not good. I thought the beef would be promising since in the pictures it kind of reminded me of Korean bulgogi  beef.  In the pictures on truck the beef is dark n glazed like bulgogi beef. There was a slight drizzle of terrakyaki sauce that should have been more generous on the beef served. The beef looked gray and tasted steam instead of grilled n seared. You know when you overcrowd the meat in a pan and it just  boils/ steams while it cooks? That's how it tasted. The  beef was so fatty and  had so many tendon pieces attached that made it chewy. My coworker was complaining to me that the beef had way too much tendon  and I replied he should just tear off the tendon pieces. Then he showed me a big piece of beef that was basically all tendon! The pork was the best of the three but was missing the pizazz flavor I was looking for. Macaroni salad was not good, you could taste the black pepper and mayonnaise and that's it. The pineapple slaw was basically a regular slaw, it was not  even sweet like you would expect from pineapple and I found I found 1 chunk of pineapple in said slaw. I've  had decent coleslaw and macaroni salad from publix, which was far better, just to give a comparison.",2017-07-11 21:50:55

I ordered the hot braised chicken and crab rangoon. I was a little disappointed to see that you can only get whole orders of these instead of half like many other Chinese restaurants offer. That made my order total a bit more than I normally spend on Chinese food, granted the portions were generous.

How was the food you ask? Well it  was extremely underwhelming, sad to say. The hot braised sauce was way too sweet and had very little heat to it, which made the dish quite bland. It also doesn't reheat very well since the sauce basically turns to gelatin when refrigerated. The crab rangoon were the bitter kind (which I prefer) but they were also very bland and actually sort of cold when I got them.

I ordered a T-Rex cake for my son's birthday and the final product was nothing even remotely resembling what I was told would be made. Moreover, at the time of ordering, I was told that the decorators were excited to make such a cool cake with a realistic dinosaur. I sent three examples of similar cakes then discussed the design on the phone. I asked for rocks and leaves to adorn the cake, as shown in one of my examples, and was told ""oh, yes we even have little candies that look like rocks!"". No rocks or leaves were on my cake!

I hoped to get an extra special cake for which I paid 145 of my hard earned dollars. The problem was not in my communication of my expectations. It is my suspicion that my cake was not given the appropriate amount of time or attention to make what was promised. I feel like I was duped - an expensive lesson. I had no choice but to take the cake because the party was the very next morning and I picked up (per the shop's request) at closing time on Saturday evening. I sent an email to complain about the entire ordeal and received no response for three days. Finally I called and ask for someone to address my concerns and I received an email response blaming me for not emailing details requesting all the things that I was promised on the phone. I wrongfully assumed that a telephone conversation and clear promises about what I would receive were enough.

When we returned the car, we got billed an additional $97.07. 

The person on duty took 50% off of those charges. However, I don't think it's right that we got charged at all and I expect Dollar take 100% responsibility. Otherwise Dollar will lose 2 of its customers. To us these are borderline fraudulent business practices unless you take responsibility and refund your customer. 

I sent an email to customer service a week ago to complain, and I haven't heard back to this day. I called the customer support (800-800-5252) today, was overall transferred 5 times, which totaled in 1 hour of waiting loop. Nobody could help me. 

Highlights from the call: Customer Service (Jenny) couldn't help me, because the process wasn't closed out internally. I got transferred. The next lady couldn't help me either, nor could she transfer me. She gave me the number for Customer Relations: 888-777-6095, apparently Hertz Customer Relations. The lady there (Joey) couldn't help me, because she couldn't access Dollar contracts. She send me back to the number I originally called. This time I got to the ""Post-rental"" department (or something similar). The lady couldn't help me, because although the process was closed out now, it wasn't posted! REALLY? So she told me to transfer me to the Security department. In reality, I ended up at the Vehicle Control department. While the lady there was the first one who was trying to help, after being put on hold twice, she must have hung up. At some point I also asked to talk to the supervisor, but I was told that there was no supervisor around. UNREAL!!! 

Looking forward to hearing back from you, Dollar! No seriously, please get back to me.

I then asked for almond shaped nails, and again, she had no clue what I was talking about. I googled a picture of the almond shape for her, which she said she could do. 

Against my better judgement, I stayed.  A decision I immediately began to regret. She used entirely too much glue when she was adding the tips to my nails. I literally had glue dripping down to the bottoms and sides of my fingers. Then she rushed through drilling, filing, and polishing my nails. I had more polish on my cuticles than on the nails.

The gumbo was good, a nice little bowl to have on a chilly night (this was back in January 20, 2012--sorry folks, it's been a BUSY winter with work and renovations).  The ""Accidental Tourist"" (and yes, the name does conjure up a few images)....not so interesting, at all.  It was a chicken enchilada with black beans and rice....done.  Nothing to write home about, nor go into detail about.

For dessert, we ordered the ""Chocolate Pate"" which was very nice....thank goodness.

At work, it's a known that every time the wind blows Comcast is going to be out... it will always be out during business hours... it will maintain a 99.99% uptime because 99.99% of a year leaves 87.6 hours of  downtime, all of which will be during business hours.  My work has been down for 3 business days this year already, all within May and June.

Yesterday at 2pm lightning struck near my house.  I have Comcast business class at my house as, well, I have to be connected to the internets, or I'm kind of useless.  So, Comcast goes down, as it does at my house whenever the power flickers.  I call in and check, known area outage,call again at 5ish, known outage ETA 7:30, call at 9 known outage eta 11pm, I now have to go and use internet via Sprint (my phone) to complete my job.. eh, no biggie, cost of doing business just went up $30 a month to have Comcast, but whatever.  Wake up, eta is now 11am.  Sometime around noon it comes back up.

I call to get my credit.  They show that my modem was online and never lost a signal all night.  I mention that it was off for a very long time during the storm as, well, I yanked it from the wall.  He showed no known issues in the area, but then again ""he's not doubting me"".  I told him the Comcast line truck was a block down from 7pm -9am that I know of, and that my neighbor's residential was down, and that I have a call from Comcast on my phone informing me that the service was back up, so I don't know how he can be seeing that my modem never lost signal.  He doesn't know either.

Quick bit of finance here,let's assume a Comcast employee makes $15 an hour to answer the phone.  We'll also put it out there that Comcast Business Class, which is what I have, is $99.99 a month.  For one day's outage all I was asking for was about $3.50 (damn you sea monster) in time credit.  The phone call took over 20 minutes, in which I lost any belief that the hands are connected to the head of Comcast.  20 minutes at $15 an hour is $4.50 they spent in their time to give me a $3.50 credit.  That's just what they wasted.

Sadly there is no competition at these speeds for a reasonable price.  So, if you're getting Comcast Business class for your home, factor in you'll also need wireless 3g/4g tethering from your phone company if you absolutely need to be on the internet (I believe Sprint sells that at about $30 a month).",2011-06-16 20:47:52

I entered with two of my children with the intent of obtaining a new innertube for my mountain bike. Prior to arriving, I had called to inquire about the cost of a patch ($5) and replacement innertube ($8). Upon arrival, the gentleman behind the desk, who I presumed to be the owner, assisted me in obtaining a replacement tube. He was very professional, and even checked the inside of the actual tire for any sharp objects when he realized I brought it with me. Then, he had partially filled the inner tube, place it on the rim, and inflated it to the proper pressure. I was very satisfied with the level of service, until I was rung up at the cash register. The total was $19 and change. I was caught off guard and surprised, as I was told over the phone that it would be eight dollars. I asked about the discrepancy, and was told there was a $10 labor charge to insert the tube on the rim- something that took him a matter of seconds. I explained I was not told this upfront, and was disappointed. His response was that this is customary. My position is that charging a fee after a service without knowing what the fee is in advance is neither appropriate or nor professional. I had intended to take the minute or two it would have taken at home to insert the tube on the rim, and thought he was doing a professional courtesy by doing so for me. Boy, was I fooled!

I tried this place out twice since sports clips in carrollwood disappeared... It's good they staff more hairdressers because the wait time is less than sports clips used to be. They are also $2 cheaper than sports clips. 

The problem is: I think the Jane's are more concerned about tips and wearing the most revealing clothing than actually cutting your hair correctly. 

My hair style is simple for any hair dresser (and should be more simple for ones that cut men's hair all day). #2 with a medium fade and just fade the top (sits in a comb over). This is a super common hair cut right now. Fading a #2 should be stupid easy. 

Somehow these Jane's on two separate occasions have done stupid things.

Then first time I went the lady was meticulous and did a great job everywhere, except she left this giant section of non shortened hair on the back of my head. Well, based on head shape that was a ridiculously silly thing to so. Every hair dresser I've had that does this cut, has cut down this section because it's obviously wrong. The hair sticks out and won't fold over because I have a calic. She chose to forget hair school and leave it

The next hair cut the girl made a comment on how that should not be done that way. She even asked what fade I wanted:medium my reply. I asked her to keep the top somewhat long because I liked it longer (still not that long). She obliged. 10 minutes later I had a high top with a high fade... Wtf?

I've had these in the past (used to be military) and there's no fixing it after she didn't do her job or listen to my answers to her own questions.

Needless to say, the company brags about being better than great clips and every where else in town but really they are like a Lexus. They have flashy seating and bells and whistles (TV's on the walls) but the car is still a piece of expensive junk that is going to have major repair costs (new hair cuts).

Shellpoint/NewRez directs, incentivizes, or conspires with its employees to commit fraud using the following tactics: 

1. Shellpoint/NewRez refused to communicate with the applicant promptly and honestly about the status of the loan application. 

2. Shellpoint/NewRez made multiple requests for documents from the applicant then refused to review the documents in a timely manner. After a period of months, Shellpoint/NewRez requested similar documents. Examples include bank statements, paystubs, and credit reports.

3. Shellpoint/NewRez attempted to terminate loan applications by surreptitiously posting document requests on its web portal and then failing to communicate those requests to the applicant via email/phone or through their employees. When the applicant failed to respond, a postal letter was sent to threaten to terminate the application. 

4. Shellpoint/NewRez made piecemeal and last moment document requests hoping to further delay or thwart the applicant.

5. Shellpoint/NewRez used several tiers of handlers to prolong the loan application process. Some tiers include: mortgage consultant, loan processor, customer care.

My home mortgage was serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, and I applied for a refinance with their partner company NewRez LLC in 9/2020. I was assigned to a mortgage consultant (Thomas Baxter) who used several of the tactics listed above to prolong the application process until Jan 2021. In Jan 2021, I was assigned to a loan processor (Julie Rodriguez) who prolonged the process with additional document requests (including previously requested documents) and long periods without communication until March 2021. Finally, I was assigned to customer care (Angela Paci) who posed several more questions, but who then failed to acknowledge receipt of my answers.

In April 2021, I searched BBB, Twitter, CFPB for mentions of Shellpoint/NewRez and realized that this company was engaged in a scam to prevent refinancing. When confronted by the accusation, the response from Shellpoint/NewRez was to was to assign me another loan processer (Jason Baker) who immediately began using the tactics above to request updated documents that I had previously sent to the previous loan processor (Julie Rodriguez).

In conclusion, Shellpoint/NewRez and its employees are committing fraud against refinance applicants. They are systematically prolonging the application process using delay tactics that mostly involve document requests, failure to communicate, and multiple tiers of handlers. The practice is so widespread that it is obviously incentivized or promoted by senior leadership at the company. The goal of the fraud is obvious: Shellpoint/NewRez has nothing to gain by letting its borrowers refinance to lower interest rates.",2021-04-09 02:46:25

I know its not unreasonable since I've found many amazing places to eat sushi but I am unforgiving in my pursuit of excellence. 
Being raised in Vancouver I've had a plethora of sushi from all different types of restaurants but never from one that offers pho on the same menu. These are totally different food groups that require a very different attention to detail. Neither is better or worse but they are very different. 
This is my first and only time I have ever eaten at Maki Maki and I will never order sushi from here again. I would consider trying the pho but my first experience was such a disappointment that I'm not sure I'll ever step a foot through the door again.
We ordered 4 dishes... Every plate had something very wrong with it. As well, there was no attention to detail at all! The pieces of fish were hacked into different sizes with a dull knife and someone with very little knife skills. The rolls were butchered with the same inexperienced hand into random sizes with inconsistent amounts of toppings and fillings. The sashimi was at the same time frozen in the center and distinctly fishy in smell and taste. There was no balance in flavors as the amount of rice overpowered any flavor from the spicy scallop filling. Evey bite was a let down and I had trouble finishing my dinner. 
The decor is also dated and sad. It does nothing to improve the dining experience much less give me confidence of the cleanliness of the management, ownership and cooks. The well thumbed menus that list beers and drinks that are no longer available is a precursor for what is to come. 
My belief is to do something well and stick to it. You cannot serve pho along side sashimi and expect a high quality in both. This place oozes mediocrity and ambivalence and those are two ingredients that should never be added to a raw dish.",2015-03-25 14:10:55

At about 20 min. into our wait 2 tables leave. One of the tables gets cleaned and a ""reserved"" sign gets placed on it. The other table gets cleared and instead of being wiped off, I see the Manager come over and wipe the crumbs from the table onto one of the chairs. Then one of the reservations walks in a is seated immediately. This is the first table we have seen seated, and they were 20 min. late for their reservation. The Manager then proceeds to seat the group of people in front of us at the table that she had previously wiped the crumbs onto the seat.

When we are finally seated a lovely waitress comes over and takes our drink order. We begin to look over the menu and choose a few things to share. We were really excited to try the basket of popovers as well as the many different spreads that go with it. My fiancee also ordered the turkey and bacon bagel with breakfast potatoes and I ordered the egg white sandwich with fruit. Unfortunately the popovers were so overcooked and dry that they were inedible. When my fiancee's sandwich came it was not what the menu would lead you to believe. In place of turkey, there was turkey sausage. The fruit with my sandwich looked like it had been left out for hours and consisted mostly of dessicated and near rotting melon (see picture attached).

When we brought our disappointments to the attention of our server (who actually was pretty great), she sent the manager over who then proceeded to blame the server for miss-communicating the menu intentions and condescendingly gave an insincere apology for our unfortunate experience and then invited us back for another try.

I would like to preface my review by saying that I am very into good food, cooking it and eating it. I have a few favorite Chinese restaurants in Philadelphia and one in South Jersey that have been anointed by the professional food critics as authentic. 

I dined at Han Dynasty with my husband. I decided to try a selection of the most popular dishes. We had the noodles, dumplings, and the fish dry pot. The noodles had bits of something, I assume that it was ground pork, in the bottom, but it wasn't crispy. The noodles were overlooked and not spicy, although they were floating in an oil slick of red oil.

I asked the waiter about the heat factor. He told e that they dialed down the heat two notches for Cherry Hill, (why?) but that my next two dishes would be a 10. The dumplings were good, the sauce was spicy, but not very spicy and once again, there was a lot of that red oil in the dish.

The fish dry pot arrived, with a little more heat and a lot more oil. It was ok.

The service was friendly and attentive. The dining room is attractive. Maybe we caught an off night. I was dismayed at the amount of oil and the lack of any nuanced spice.

Food: in general the food quality was still good. I think they have changed the seasoning on their steaks since the last time I ate there, I think it's a little overkill, a good steak should stand on its own with maybe just a little butter, salt, and pepper but they have a really salty blend of something they put on there. You could probably ask for it without but I don't know. Everyone seemed pretty happy with theirs though. Lamb chops were highly rated as was the prime rib by others I ate with. I seem to remember them having a selection of bread, but this time we just got some chewy, marginal dinner rolls.

Service: This is where it has imploded. We didn't see our appetizers for almost 30 minutes, and our main course took almost an hour and fifteen. During this time the server was largely absent. At one point we had to flag down the manager just to get refills on our water glasses. The restaurant was not busy. One steak was grossly overcooked and it took probably 20 minutes for a replacement that arrived undercooked. If you're a ""steakhouse"" you should have steak cooking down to a literal science.

All in all it wasn't terrible, but it used to be great. I don't know if there was a big shakeup in management or what but they need to step up their game. We won't be back in the near future.

A funny bit: there's several misspelled words on their menu and dessert menu, the most comical being a ""Peanut Butter Mouse Bar"".",2016-04-04 00:53:24

Very awkward with counter ordering and then scrambling for a table. There is no customer service as I asked three times for ketchup and butter and finally had to stand at the ordering counter until they could get it. Food was mediocre and portions were small. i.e.: a side of toast is a single piece, most orders only include a single egg. 

The tables appear to be home made as you can't fit two chairs between the table legs but with the configuration of the tables, that's the only way to sit. 

Finally, the prices are way too high. I paid almost $14 for coffee, a single egg dish, and a single slice of toast. Too much for an average meal, especially given that this is essentially a self service eatery.

On a recent weekend night, there was only one employee working. When we arrived, she was sitting at the end of the counter playing on her phone. She jumped up, washed her hands, and greeted us. Great! She handled our orders just fine, but several groups came in behind us and she surely could have used a coworker to help out. Plus, how safe is it to only have one employee working?

I opted for the flight and chose chocolate orange, mint chocolate chip, peppermint patty, birthday cake, and strawberry cheesecake. By far, the chocolate orange was the best. The birthday cake had no flavor, the strawberry cheesecake was freezer burned, and the peppermint patty tasted the exact same as the mint chocolate chip, not a York, which I anticipated. I missed having the captain's butterscotch, salted caramel, and cookie monster flavors I had last year. I picked the chopped nuts and chocolate sprinkles for my toppings. The rainbow sprinkles looked so old in the container their color had faded and judging by the crunchiness of the chocolate sprinkles, I'm going to guess they'd been there a while. My husband- a milkshake lover- said his chocolate one was ""fine.""

The place was a wreck, too. Tables and seats were sticky, dried ice cream (at least, that's what I hope it was) on the seats, and trash on the tables and floors. I totally get this is a family friendly place, but cleanliness goes a long way and like I said, even though there was only one employee working, she was on her phone when we arrived, so surely she could have swiped a rag over the tables and seats.

I'm sure that at times this place is fun. However, on the night I went, at least 4 people (including myself) had their wallets stolen out of purses and pockets, I am assuming while dancing. I first noticed my wallet was missing and went outside to begin calling my banks right away. My friend then checked her bag and noticed her stuff was missing too. While I was outside, at least two other people were saying the same thing happened to them. There happened to be police officers outside so we all took turns talking to them, although at that point there wasn't much they could do. Eventually the club closed while we were all still on our phones and as people were filing out, I really had to use the bathroom and wasn't sure how I was going to get home with no wallet, so I explained to the bouncers that the reason I stepped out was to use my phone because my wallet was stolen and could I please take a minute to use the bathroom. They refused. 

I know this was probably just bad luck - someone was clearly out on a mission to steal wallets that night. However, the atmosphere of the club was also just not that great. It was fun to dance with my friends but other people there were really aggressive. At one point a guy started dancing with me and grabbed my hand and licked my fingers. I kept having to tell people no and they didn't want to take no for an answer.

I wanted a badass steak so I went with the dry-aged ribeye. This place lets you go chat with the chef and choose which steak you'd like. I went up with some friends from my table and we got the rundown of the different steaks and asked some questions. Pretty cool experience, but the chef pointed out an obviously oxidized (brownish) steak from the bunch as one of his top picks, tried to tell me that medium rare was 165 degrees, and said they are trained to cook to temperature by feel (which is actually not possible). I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just smiled, let this all go, picked my steak, and told them I wanted mine medium rare. 

Welp, I got my steak and wouldn't you now it - it wasn't cooked properly. At least they err'ed on the side of caution and it was nice and rare. You can tell they fired it too hot because the outside was close to overdone. I sent it back and they just re-fired mine instead of bringing me a new one (which is pretty taboo when you're at a nice restaurant). Steak still had wonderful taste, but the crust was a bit overdone at this point and, because they re-cooked it was about medium. Glad I got the ribeye and not the filet...

Anyway, in closing I really like this place. Great atmosphere, beer, oysters, and steak selection. I just can't get past paying so much money for a steak and it being ruined by some under-trained chefs. If you're going to specialize in steak, please make sure your chefs know their stuff. 

I'll give this another chance next time I'm in town and hope that they fix this situation. I really want to love this place.

Finally, almost 30 minutes later, we had our food, but the order still wasn't right. At that point, we weren't willing to wait any longer and took our food home.

My kids were well behaved the whole hour we were there. A waitress dropped by after 20 minutes of waiting and took our order. She said she would ""expedite"" our order since we were waiting. Never saw her again, so we got up and left after another 30 minute wait. This place wasn't busy, there was at least 5 people on the wait staff.

I liked the mom-and-pop vibe, and the server seemed genuinely excited about the food when I asked her to recommend her favorite items on the menu.  I thought that was a good sign.  So I decided to order the Pajeon (it was not crispy at all) with Kimchi (not a big fan), and Kalbi-tang (the authentic flavors of this beef stew really hit the spot on this cold winter day), while my hubby ordered the Korean style chicken wings.  He and the server even had a few chuckles during their discussion about how spicy he prefers his wings.  We were on a tight schedule so we ordered our food to go.  BIG MISTAKE.  It wasn't until we got home 45 mins later when we discovered the chicken wings were missing.  Why wouldn't they pack everything together and why would she ring us up and send us on our way if our order wasn't complete yet? Needless to say, my hubby had to call them to ask for a refund on the wings we were charged, they said they still had our wings if we wanted to come back and pick it up, to which he replied NO, he's not driving another 45 mins both ways.

Located in a nice plaza behind McDonald's, parking is plentiful and the outdoor dining area seems cozy for entertainment. Service was nice, attentive, and ordering was a breeze. We really wanted to like this place as they do have daily specials that can be ordered to go as well. 
However, we were not impressed with the food whatsoever. We ordered a of variety of dishes on the menu: Braised skirt steak risotto, meatloaf sliders, grilled chicken sandwich, chicken pot pie, sloppy Joe, Italian prosciutto flatbread, sausage Parmesan flatbread, Buffalo chicken flatbread, plain cheese flatbread with chicken. Not to get into too much detail but I do not recommend any of those items. Flat bread looks nothing like the pictures on Yelp. 
Let's just say my son got up halfway stopped eating and made a peanut butter sandwich for dinner, His plain cheese pizza somehow had jalapeños in the sauce . The red onion on other flatbreads was overpowering, toppings and sauce are scarce, and you mostly taste the breading. The risotto is a more expensive dish yet was made too oily with again - little to no sauce nor distinct flavor . Tasted mostly of oily pasta and unseasoned steak. The chicken pot pie was like soup poured into a container with a giant pie crust placed on top. The bottom part of the pot pie was nowhere to be found.

I decided to order Grillsmith for my team for our holiday lunch this past week.  I called ahead 24 hours in advance to place my order.  When I arrived the next day to pick it up, I was told that one of the items was not available that day.  I called my teammate, who picked another dish.  It still took about 30 minutes for the food to come out.  I noticed when I got the food that the food that they said they did not have was there.  The staff noted that the chef ended up picking up this item, so we were given both.  They apologized for the wait and I was on my way.

When I got back to the office, I passed all of the dishes out to my team members.  Everyone was happy (including me) with the quality of their food, except for one person, who noted her lemon feta chicken was pink on the inside.  I called the restaurant and explained the situation and they noted that they would make another order of the chicken for her.  I advised that she would come by in an hour to pick up the chicken.  When she got there, she had to wait 20 minutes again.

Here is the thing:  I love Grillsmith's food way too much to not frequent this restaurant again.  I was just really disappointed, mostly in the long wait times after advising when we would come by.  I will say that the staff was apologetic about the situations and were very professional, but myself and my employee spent a lot of time getting the food this day.

This was the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had in New Orleans. Maybe we came on a bad night, but to be honest it was a standard busy Saturday and we were super excited to finally try out this place. 

The only positive things about the night were that we were seated quickly and the ambiance was cool. The drinks were also decent. However, it pretty much went downhill from there: 

1. Nobody came to take our drink order- or any order period- for about 30-40 minutes after being seated. Sadly we had to flag down a hostess to get a drink and to even have waters poured. 
2. Our waitress completely screwed up our order. The wrong entree was brought out and took another hour to replace; a vegetable dish that we ordered was never brought out; garlic bread was brought out 2 hours later after we had already finished our entrees and drinks and were done with our dinner.
3. Best dish we had was the blue crab risotto, which compared to all the other deliciousness in NOLA, was pretty average. The meatballs and garlic bread were good but WAY too salty. Literally the garlic bread must have had sea salt heavily sprinkled on top. The lamb shank was ok, but nothing special. The carrot purée that came with it was pretty tasty though. Overall the Food was mediocre... I could've let this slide but with the food and atrocious service I was completely over this place. 
4. Dessert and coffee were never offered to us. 
5. Our check was still Incorrect with the wrong entrees on it. Took another 30 mins to fix. 
6. Waited around to have our bill closed out by the waitress, who never returned. We again had to flag down a hostess to close our bill out. 
7. It was clear that other parties/ couples around us were feeling similarly frustrated and just wanted to get the hell out of there asap.

The oysters on the oyster appetizer are similarly tiny.

The main courses suffer from an unfortunate change in the menu selections. They have completely removed the bowl dishes and substituted a nearly duplicative pho selection that is only distinguished by combos rather than a la cart choices. 

Many of the other main courses suffer from a lack of substance. The lamb neck, which is usually a winner, had almost no lamb on my last two visits. Most of the other dishes are similarly deficient.

Hopefully, they will recover from this down cycle. When they are on, they are a four star restaurant, just not right now.",2015-09-02 01:51:48

After the hardwood install, I briefly looked at it as my kids were home and they had been at my home for hours.  The installer makes it a point to say if there are any issues or concerns, please call this number.  He writes his name and number on back of the paperwork.  Later that evening, I was able to inspect.  Issue one is the threshold for each room.  It is so high that 3 people end of tripping over it,  Which is extremely dangerous. Issue two is my CARPET.  I take extreme care of my carpet and do not wear shoes.  During the install, they careless move the drop cloths and trampled my carpet which is now stained.  Issue three: Dents, Dings, Chips throughout the entire floor (which is supposed to be armormax protected) Not only that, they spaced the planks too far apart and used this putty type substance to fill in the gaps. Next issue: Not sure who comes to install anything without the proper clean up tools, but they left my home a wreck.  Wood planks on the front porch, lawn and dust everywhere.  Another issue: They install the hardwood over an existing steps (not cut down the carpeted top step and place the wood) so it is sitting up higher.  ANOTHER hazard.

So, needless to say, I call them and they come back out.  (In between this time I had the carpet that they trampled steam cleaned and was told that the stains wont come out.) When they come they have an excuse for everything.  The dents and dings are normal.  They bring in wood stain pens for me to pick a color to fill in all the chips throughout.  (i ordered the stain on amazon) And, they again continue to trample the carpet even though I told them that the floor was just cleaned",2016-10-04 16:40:12

The guy hopped the small fence of the pool (we were already in the venue) instead of going through it's gate and the bouncer started kicking him! The guy didn't even resist, and I heard him offer to go back the right way but instead, the bouncer put him in a chokehold and dragged him away then- the bouncer slams his head against the support beam!

I described my problem and the woman told me she would check with Dr Choate to see if he needed to see me. She told me I needed to come in right away. She said she could schedule me for an emergency appointment at 2:15 that day. I told her I had to be at work at 4:00. She told me that wouldn't be an issue because I would be out of the office before then. I made the appointment. I arrived at 2:10 and let the receptionist know I was there for my emergency appointment. She told me it would be just a few minutes. 30 minutes later I told her that I had to be at work at 4:00 and that I was told I would be finished with my eye exam on time so I could get to work. She told a another worker in the back and said she understood, and that it would be just a few more minutes. 30 more minutes and I was taken back to room with a nurse at 3:15. She asked me what was wrong with my eye and repeated the issue. During our conversation Mr Choate walks in and looks around the room. He then asks her where a different patient was, and she said in the waiting room. He left to handle another patient. She said it would be just a few more minutes before Mr. Choate could see me. 15 minutes later Mr Choate comes into my room and says he can't look at my eye unless he dilates it, and since I have to be at work I would have to come back. I wait for the receptionist to finish with another patient with just a few minutes until I have to be at work when I greet the receptionist she tells me I have to pay $20 for my co pay. I didn't have time to question the charge because I didn't want to be terribly late to work. She tells me to come back the next day so they can figure out what's wrong with my eye. My mom called to find out why they charged a co pay when they did not provide a service, and how much I would be charged the next day. They said there was no charge for the next visit because they aren't charging for the next day. I called March 15, 2011 to confirm and a woman named Debroah said she spoke with Dr. Choate and that he plans to charge a co pay for today's visit. I questioned how I would be charged twice for something. She said they were willing to perform the service of an eye exam but I had to leave. I explained to her that I was told I would be out of the office in time for work, and that's why I scheduled the appointment. I reminded her that I even told the receptionist at the desk that I had to be at work at 4:00 multiple times. They orchestrated this situation so they could charge me twice. 


After my experience that evening I can't trust them with my emergency eye problem, so I will never return. They didn't respect the appointment I made. They were very unprofessional in how they handled my emergency. They have fraudulently billed my insurance company for services I never received. They only care about money gained from exploiting an ailing patient.",2011-09-22 16:22:51

We decided to have Jensen pack us as well as move us.  I scheduled everything months in advance so that it would go smoothly.  The packers were to come on a Thursday morning at 9 and never arrive until after noon.  One of them was not their usual packer and had very little motivation or energy.  I had to tell him what to pack and keep an eye on him the entire time.  I packed boxes along side of him thinking it would give the idea but it didn't work.  The packers only stayed until 3:30.  I was sooooo mad!  The move was scheduled for the next day.  So much for planning ahead.  I called and left a message for the person I had been communicating with and never received a return call.

They arrived the next morning with the regular packers who moved quickly from the time they arrived until they were finished.  They had to bring extra movers on the loading end and at our new home.

I am not sure what happened to this company but I would not recommend them.

This is the first time I have used Jensen.  I sent a request for a quote via their website and received a call before 9 am the next day.

On moving day the truck arrived over an hour late (called the office when they were 30 minutes late and was not told the truth), however, Dave and Rob made up for the ""misinformation"" the office provided.  I cannot stress enough how professional, personable and hard working they both were.  They did not stop moving from the time they came until they were finished.  The move was June 10th and the weather was not good...rain, rain, rain.  But that did not stop Dave and Rob from doing an excellent job.  We did have damage...a leg was broken off a small wooden table, but to me, it was no biggy (that could have happened if we moved it in our car).  The cost came in below the quoted price.

A girl who had a pain in her back (tho she didn't seem to have any problems playing with the top of the door, trying to figure out how to keep it open, letting out a scream only when a medical person would pass) was seen within minutes of being brought to her room, was given a shot and released.  2. A man with a pain in his leg was seen and discharged with ibuprofen and 'ice it'.  3. A woman who had been in the hospital a few weeks prior for pneumonia but now 'wasn't feeling well' (no MD?) was x-rayed and released.   Add to this debacle - The soap dispenser in the bathroom did not work NOR did the hand sanitizer in the room I was in.   I'll walk to Paoli if I need ER ever again.",2015-08-05 17:06:42

I've never had that much salt in my life, on not just the appetizer but our entrées as well.  We were very hungry so we kinda powered through, but our waitress finally came by when I flagged her down (they were not busy) and asked if we wanted a box, to which I told her that I felt like I ate a pound of salt and was not offered anything.

I must say that it was not a enjoyable experience however as a college student on a budget, you don't have many options in the area if you don't have a car.  

Management and Leasing Agents:  horrible to work with, and absolute disaster and uneducated group.  Initially when getting the apartment, the layout was completely different from the room we were given and had no washer or dryer despite being told so (we'd been told via conversation but found out it was not on the lease).  Every year our rent increased by $100 dollars without being informed so we ended up being charged late fees a few months into the year which we had to pay back (horrible situation)!!!!  

Security - a joke, and provide no feeling of protection and I often smelt drug smoke down the hallway (sadly from a young family who had small children).  A few years ago there were many drug busts in the building and I even had the opportunity to be asked to get out of the elevator since a group of policemen were heading up.

wTvgW8-wBU0nscVbtnVnxw,gydhMRmh87ovByBNMcm3dg,AMi1h-goNueHf_Lvx4Cu4g,2.0,8,1,2,"Whole Foods in Santa Barbara has an attitude problem -- and that's a direct indicator of bad management. Virtually all of the cashiers seem to hate their jobs and they have no interest in ""friendly service with a smile"". With only rare exceptions, they seem angry, hostile, bored and disinterested. They are content to do the bare minimum to process a customer's order with as few words as possible. Who hires these people and how do they keep their jobs?

I'm writing this review after approximately 100 visits to this store. I shop at the Santa Barbara Whole Foods about three times a week mostly out of convenience because it's a couple minutes from my studio/office. Plus, I'm vegan and they carry certain items I like. Unfortunately, I usually leave the store feeling that my patronage was completely unappreciated and that makes me resentful that I spent my money there. Not a good business model!

Cashiers reflect the personality of any grocery store. A cashier is often the only employee a customer interacts with on a visit to the store. Their appearance, attitude and personality directly reflect upon the entire business and the customers' shopping experience. A good cashier treats every customer like a VIP and makes them feel good about shopping there. That concept is completely absent from the shopping experience at Whole Foods in Santa Barbara.

My very first visit still haunts me. It was a quiet day with about five cashiers on duty and no customers checking out when I was ready to do so. I innocently stepped up to the closest cashier, not realizing it was the ""Express"" lane. The cashier literally put her hands behind her back and stared at my grocery basket asking, ""Do you have 10 items or less?"" I said, ""I didn't count them, but if you're too busy to help, I'll go to another register."" She reluctantly began processing my order, but severely chastised me the entire time for picking the wrong register. It turns out I had 13 items instead of 10, but the cashier treated me like I just tried to rob the store at gunpoint. 

Since then, I've had very negative experiences with a handful of the cashiers there and I now know to AVOID those cashiers: One cashier yelled at me when I moved my shopping basket a little too close to his register while trying to make room for the customer behind me (the grocery conveyor belts are very short at this store and I was trying to be considerate of the next customer). Another cashier intentionally shoved her entire finger deep into one of my ripe tomatoes because I made a polite suggestion regarding how to properly bag groceries. (She was randomly dumping everything into my bag with no care or organization at all. I suspect they receive no training on proper grocery bag packing.) Yet another cashier demanded that I remove my groceries from the hand basket because (she said) that was my job and not hers. (The unusually short conveyor belt makes it more polite to the next customer to keep groceries confined to a smaller footprint by leaving them in the basket.) I could go on, but I have limited space here to tell all my negative experiences at that store.

I know what I'm talking about because I was a cashier at Ralph's many years ago. I've done that job and I'm proud that I did it well. We received thorough training before being allowed to serve actual customers. Our guiding principle was ""The customer is king"" and we were constantly reminded of that by our managers. If we ever treated any customer with the level of disrespect that is common practice at the Whole Foods in Santa Barbara, we would have been looking for a new job the very next day.

UPDATE June 1, 2018: A couple weeks after posting my negative review of the Whole Foods Market in Santa Barbara, someone named Yvonne M. from WF Business Customer Services tagged my review with a condescending invitation to contact her regarding my complaint.

Two of my friends ordered the chicken and waffle meal that included three tenders. My friend asked how large the chicken tenders were and the waiter said they were a pretty good size, some of the biggest he's seen, and most people can't finish the waffle and chicken. I ordered the Sharon plate which was an egg, bacon, cheese, and tomato on between an English muffin, served with hash browns. 

When we got our meals, we noticed the chicken was definitely not large at all. In fact they were even on the small side. I'm pretty sure I could get bigger tenders at Burger King. The waiter graciously took them back when he noticed they were actually very small. Here's the kicker - the new tenders that were served to us obviously undercooked on the outside so we decided to check the core. The middle of the tenders were straight up raw (see picture). The waiter took those back as well and sent out another new batch, which he was very nice and apologetic about. 

In terms of food quality, this place was just not there for me. The chicken had no seasoning what so ever, very bland. The hash browns were pretty greasy with no flavor as well. I did have a bite of the waffles which were pretty good.

I've been here a couple of times and haven't had much to complain about, I've really enjoyed their food and services, but that changed when I planned a larger group event. With the increase in guests their care of us got exponentially worse. Every other time I've been here there has only been two ladies and they seemed to handle us well no hick ups. This time I made a 15 person table the first thing that happened was when we arrived they miscounted our table setting and it took about 10 minutes to get it handled and with three different servers that were not communicating to each other we kept getting more chairs and more plates and settings that had to be removed or brought back. The service this time seemed subpar and almost crass. I don't know if it was because they knew we had to pay a 18% gratuity anyway, but they were not very hospitable and I even felt ignored, they barely looked at us and often overlooked us for other smaller groups. One serve even said ""I barely saw you out of the corner of my eye"" because they never looked at our table directly. The food was sloppily presented Family style which I did not expect considering it was always plated individually before, I don't mind the sharing but the way it was arranged made my event feel slapdash and childish. We were constantly having to reorder things from different servers because the other would forget. What really pushed the Brunch to a bad place was that a plate of half burnt scones was dropped off, not only did it look bad, but it smelled worse and to have that placed in front of us was unappetizing and a huge oversight by the staff. One of my guests was also horribly talked down to by the staff in a very berating way when she asked for butter for her scone the server which I think was the owner stopped and said ""you are in a tea house and you don't want butter, here we use Devonshire cream and not butter for our scones"" this I feel was not the way to talk to a customer and embarrass them in front of a large group.

It was a bit on the dry side and the crepe seemed overall uninspired - a problem as the waiter described the section of the menu I ordered from was supposed to be the owner's specialties.  Ingredients weren't what I normally think of from a Philly Creperie.  The meal was way overpriced, the portion smaller than most crepe places I've been and the restaurant lost and extra star for serving me my coke in a can.

Watch your bill.  We had a change to a crepe - from goat cheese to swiss - and they tried charging $3.50 for the cheaper cheese.  Tea was 5 bucks, cokes were expensive too.

We moved in January 2019- the apartment was brand new and we have truly enjoyed living here. For the first few months, we experienced minor bumps and growing pains while the complex filled its occupancy, but now, the issues keep piling up and the straw has broken my back. We have dealt with thin walls, inoperable amenities, a broken garage gate for 6+ weeks, break-ins and stolen bicycles from the building, and due to recent storm damage-- a flooded lower level garage leaving us with completely broken elevators for the entire building. This issue has been ongoing for several weeks at this point and the residents continue to be left with little to no communication from local or corporate management. This is completely inappropriate and residents frustrations are growing thin. The apartment advertises ""luxury living"" and very steep rent prices, but this is not the experience we are receiving. I may choose to update my review at another date once these issues are resolved and the residents are compensated for this disruption, but for now, I am thoroughly disappointed.

That, in and of itself, says something big. I took a few home pregnancy tests that came out faintly positive then went to urgent care to get it confirmed via blood testing. The results were positive. I was pregnant! My LMP was only the month before so I knew I was very early. This would have been my first baby so I didn't know how it all was supposed to work. I called this office a few days later to schedule my first prenatal appointment. They said they don't see anyone until 8 weeks, which was fine. A few days later I took another home pregnancy test and the lines were even lighter than before. Now that I was beginning to worry, I took a test for each of the next few mornings. They kept getting lighter. Again, this would have been my first baby so I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I called this office again telling them I was getting concerned that I may have lost the pregnancy because of the progressively lighter tests. The phone call made me feel like I was the dumbest person they ever could have talked to. The nurse was not supportive at all. She just basically told me to calm down. She told me I could come in for blood work but even that sounded like she was just trying to shut me up. When I came in I started having awful cramping. The nurse brought me to the back to talk for a second. Her end of the conversation consisted of: ""we only do testing if you're bleeding"" completely looking over the fact that I told her I was having awful cramps and was doubled over in pain ""your baby is only the size of the tip of my pen"" as if that made a miscarriage any easier ""if you miscarry, then you miscarry"" as if no one would be affected by an event like that just because I was early. The faces she made whenever I asked a question were as if I was asking something absurd. I left feeling dumb and upset all while still in terrible pain. The next day I started heavily bleeding and the blood results came back negative so I knew I miscarried. After the reaction from the nurse the day before, I felt like I couldn't even be upset. I felt as if I was wrong for being sad. I'm just so shocked over their response to a patient who is suspecting a miscarriage.

On Wednesday, December 2, we got there later than we expected to after making a very long wrong turn.  Therefore, when they were out of a number of things, it wasn't an issue.  We patronize many of the metro area BBQ spots and this is the norm.  I would not have expected them to be closed at 7:20, though, and that was a distinct possibility after all the comments from the cashier and later from the rest of the staff.   

Food:
*Pulled Pork sandwich - COLD 
*Kielbasa: COLD
*Half chicken:  Lukewarm
*French fries:  Lukewarm. 
*Brussels Sprouts - So hot I couldn't even eat them until last
It is very hard to judge food that isn't at the correct temperature and it should be a food safety concern.  There is no way the meat or fries were held above 140 degrees!

Atmosphere gets a zero!  The dining area was quiet with 4 tables occupied including us and since it was quiet, everything in the kitchen seemed amplified.  All the banter between the workers, all the discussions on what they had left and back and forth on if they were closing, what was already on order for the next day.  On two separate occasions the 'F' word was clearly head by everyone in the dining area.  The second time I had stood up to put on my coat and was facing the kitchen entry and watched the girl say it, she then quickly disappeared to her right out of site. My opinion is, I came to eat not to hear the ins and outs of the operation of the restaurant and most definitely not to hear profanity.  I am just thankful no children were present.

Bottom line - no need for me to spend my gas money traveling that distance when the metro area has super BBQ restaurants that, although very casual, have a much more professional atmosphere.",2015-12-08 19:49:59

The reason I have given this establishment such a poor rating is, first of all, my expectations were extremely high considering it was featured in Food Network's ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" starting Guy Fieri.  However, this is what transpired.

A group of my friends had planned to have a holiday dinner there for about 20 people.  We called to make reservations and were told it was OK.  After getting RSVPs finalized, we called back a few days later and told them that it would be 28 people actually.  Again we were told this was OK.  Then another couple days passed and then a bombshell was dropped on us.

The restaurant called us to say it was no longer OK that we had 28 people, that we now had too many people and would be charged $750 just to hold the table (this is on top of the cost of our meals).  All this just 4 days before our big get-together.  This was an unacceptable charge in our eyes (as you can imagine) so we cancelled our plans altogether.",2011-12-06 20:15:11

The water is simply drained and the blue stuff is sprinkled in and they begin filling it for the next person. The towels are interchangeably used between stations and the tools they use are never sterilized. 

I may sound picky or particular but cleanliness is extremely important when your getting work done on your hands and feet. 

The best part of the visit was the massage that I received, However,  I couldn't really enjoy it because the employees were arguing with eachother. And they leave the doors open which allowed for cigarette smoke to blow into the spa.

The manicure was painful and bloody and the lady was too busy looking away at other people as she was gouging out my cuticles.

This was the first place I tried on any wedding gowns, and their selection is huge and the young lady helping me, Tara, was extremely helpful and polite, but I didn't find my dress the first time in. 

After looking at some other stores, I found the dress I wanted.  I decided I would order with Frew's since they had some nice promotions going on.  I made an appointment to get measurements and to finalize everything.  When I arrived, they told me I wasn't on the calendar that day but they could fit me in.  The lady who measured me was extremely rude and unprofessional.  She couldn't figure out what size I needed from my measurements because I am not a perfect size 2 proportioned to fit exactly in one size.  I thought it was her job to help pick the best one and then get alterations as needed, but she was no help at all.  Finally I just told her I would go somewhere else if she couldn't help me determine my size so she decided to get a few dresses from the same designer for me to try on. 

The whole time in the fitting room she was pointing out how she was worried about the size of my hips and waist in the dress (I'm a size 14 typically, so while I'm not skinny by any means I never really thought I was so overweight that I couldn't order a wedding dress).  After 3-4 dresses she decided what size would ""probably be close enough"" which is totally reassuring as you get ready to spend $1000 on a dress.  I felt like buying a wedding dress is a big decision and something to be happy and excited about, but with this lady I just felt disgusted because she kept pointing out my flaws and didn't really seem too smart or sure of what size I should order. 

I went to the counter to make a few final decisions, and then I realized she couldn't find my personal information from the card I filled out last time I was in the store just a couple months prior.  If this store can't book my appointment correctly and can't keep track of my contact information, how could I trust them to keep track of my dress when it was received (assuming it would even fit)?  That was the last straw so we told her we would think it over and come back some other time when she kept trying to convince us to just pay and order right then.  Finally my mom said ""you know what, you clearly don't have time for us right now and this is kind of a big deal so we will just go somewhere else"" and we walked out with me in tears.  The lady didn't even blink that she was losing a customer.  With a store that big, who cares if one person doesn't buy their dress there?

I immediately when back to one of the stores I had tried previously which was much smaller, and the owner herself helped me try on a dress again before making any decisions.  She was sweet the entire time and even though I didn't get there until 20 minutes before closing and they were very busy, the employees said  they could stay late if I needed more time in the dress to think about it.  They made me feel special, and I could tell they actually cared.  I would much rather pay a little more to get great service and respect.

As I originally said, it really probably depends on which of the several employees you speak with at a place this huge.  I much prefer a smaller shop where they will remember you and treat you like an individual not just another sale (or lack thereof in this case).  After telling a few people my experience with Frew's, I have heard other negative things about how they have even given someone's wedding dress to a different bride.  That is absolutely unacceptable to me, and I will not be giving Frew's any of my business and I would caution you all to look somewhere else as well.",2014-06-19 13:07:50

The waitress arrived soon after I was seated and took a drink order. While I perused the menu, my drinks were delivered. I opted to start with the mushroom soup, followed by the traditional Thanksgiving dinner special.

A few minutes later my soup arrived. But before I could even taste the soup, my entree showed up! I politely told the runner no, I didn't want my entree until after I finished my soup. He awkwardly took the food away, leaving some warm rolls. My waitress quickly came over and apologized for the mix up. 

Then there was that soup. The unrecognizable mushroom soup which tasted mostly of onions. I decided to just eat it instead of making a second fuss.

Immediately after finishing my soup, the waitress appeared at my shoulder with my turkey entree. It was a fresh plate; it hadn't been held in a warmer. Everything was flavorful and well cooked, although the house-made cranberry sauce tasted overwhelmingly of cinnamon. With the exception of the turkey, the servings were on the smaller side, but there were a lot of items on the plate. And those rolls left on the table earlier? By the time I was halfway through my entree, they were cold and hard, so I passed on them.

A nice little shot glass dessert was offered, and the check was delivered soon after. Looking back, I was left with the impression that I had been given the bum's rush to clear the table for another guest. Not a very welcoming feeling.",2021-11-29 23:21:11

Mind you I am an experienced pet owner who has been to all manner of vets all across the country, and I have never been treated as horribly as I was treated at this ""highly recommended"" vet.

I adopted a 30-pound spaniel mixed breed dog who was about 2 years old. A few days after I got her I wanted to take her to the vet to get her checked out. I had read all the reviews about this vet, and plus I got a personal recommendation from a friend. So I took my dog there. 

The staffers at the front desk were fine. When I was taken into an examination room, a vet tech came in and she was rude, had an indifferent attitude toward my dog, and I got a very bad vibe from her. Her attitude was, for lack of a better term, very ""bitchy"". She acted as if she was annoyed at having to talk to us, or be at work that day, or whatever. She was a bitch.

Then when the vet came in accompanied by another tech (different from the tech above), the vet also had the same, non-caring, bitchy attitude. This was Dr. Harper. She was also I guess having a bad day that day. She asked me a couple of questions about the dog in a very non-caring way, and then proceeded to approach the dog to examine her.  The dog started to growl and lunge at Dr. Harper. When this happened, Dr. Harper became very very annoyed with me, told me that the dog needed medication, and that I might want to consider returning the dog to where I adopted her from. MInd you, I had only adopted this dog a few days before. I did not know she was going to react this way at the vet, and the dog has never growled at me once.

After that Dr. Harper barely examined the dog, left the room and I was checked out at the front desk very quickly. They basically wanted me and my dog out of there.

I have never been treated so poorly at a vet's office in my life, and I have been to the cheapest and the most expensive vets all over the USA.",2013-04-04 21:26:13

Otherwise, from the time I started making reservation arrangements to the time I checked out, it was one disappointment after another.  
      I made a reservation in March, then a few days later decided we would stay 2 nights instead of 1, so I called to add the 2nd night. I didn't feel confident that the day was added at the end of our phone call, but I let it go and trusted the girl updating our reservation. A few weeks later, I decided to call and double check. Good thing I did, because the change was not made, and to make matters worse, they said they had no king rooms available for the added night. Then, just as we were making progress, the call was dropped and I had to call back. When I called back and a different person answered, there was miraculously a king room available that wasn't just 10 seconds before. He made the reservation change and added a package that included parking, a free movie, and a free pizza. I was very pleased and gracious and received a confirmation email with the correct changes (ok, the only other reason besides the shower for the generous 1 star). 
    Fast forward 2 months to check in. I went in and gave the young woman my debit card and license to check in. She said my card didn't clear for authorization. I knew I didn't have enough money in my account to cover as I was being paid the next day, but didn't figure it would be a problem because I have NEVER had to prepay for a hotel room. I have always been charged at checkout every time I have ever stayed anywhere else. To be clear, this was not simply a preauthorization, they were charging it to my card. She told me I could not check in without an authorized card. I was stumped for a bit because I did not have any other way to pay her until the next day. Fortunately, I was able to get a picture of a card of mine from home sent by a family member and they used it for the preauthorization. It was at this point that she informed me the charge would be for $750.00 for the 2 nights because there is a ""security deposit"" they require. I was surprised and irritated. This is something I have again NEVER had to do at a hotel. When I voiced my frustrations, neither of the women cared at all. Despite my frustrations, I went ahead and checked in. I asked her about our parking ticket and she said we would take a ticket from the thing as we enter the garage, then we would have to bring it back down the the lobby to be stamped for validation before we could leave to go anywhere in our car. To be clear on this, every single time we went somewhere we had to do this. That is ridiculous. 
    So, we suck it up and head up to the room hoping our frustrations are over only to find more.  I attempted not to notice the stained carpet in the halls and when we got into the non-smoking room that smelled of stale, febreezed cigarettes, it was pretty toasty. So, we turned the air on just as one often has to do when going into a hotel room. Unfortunately, that didn't help because the air conditioning wasn't working. We went ahead and left to go eat supper after a bit, expecting the room would cool down. When we got back, it was still 79° in the room. At about  8:00, we called the front desk (I was on hold for at least 15 minutes) to ask for a maintenance person to come up and check the air conditioner. I also cancelled our reservation for the next night at this time. Maintenance came up shortly after and attempted to walk in the room without even knocking. What if I had been changing clothes or sitting on the toilet?! Fortunately I had the fold over lock latched (there was no dead bolt). She got to work on the air and nothing changed, but she left hoping the temp would start going down. It didn't, but we were over messing with the people in this hotel. We had a fan from home and as temps in the room ranged from 79 to 82, it made it bearable. After maintenance left, there was a mess of dust bunnies and other small debris from her work all over the floor and the floor around the toilet was puddled and wet from where she flushed some of it down the toilet. 
      Since I have already gone on forever, I will just add that check out was equally as inconvenient due to continued confusion and miscommunication from hotel staff. I had to go down to the front desk twice to attempt checkout. What's sad is that I could still tell more of our horrible experience. 
    I hope no one has to be as disappointed as I was. We don't have much, and had saved to do something nice for our anniversary. This experience literally almost ruined our trip. I'm convinced I could run a hotel better than whoever is responsible for the management and upkeep of that place and I have zero experience.

Our first visit there took forever because they had to remake my burger 4 times before it done correctly. There was a visiting manager from Phoenix who was so apologetic and trying to make it right. It was ok - they had just opened so we expected some mistakes here and there.

However. We've been back 6-10 times since then and it is like riding a roller coaster or seesaw. One time it's amazing and the next 2-3 times are dreadful. As in bringing all the food to the table, forgetting my 5 year old niece's kid's meal, and taking 30 minutes to finally get it out to her. Inexcusable.

Service is spotty at best. Drinks go unfilled, requests for this or that take forever, food comes out missing components like bacon or an incorrect side, etc.

That being said, we kept giving them chances. Until New Year's Eve.

There were 6 of us total and what a nightmare that was. It took 30 minutes after being seated before our appetizer salads came out. The restaurant was obviously short staffed so we were willing to wait but the plates the salads were on were FILTHY. I'm not talking a spot here or there, I'm talking these were previously used plates that had been quickly wiped off and then used. There was food all over the top, sides, bottoms of all plates. The silverware was dirty as well - like what it look like when you do a quick rinse before putting it into your dishwasher.

We sent it all back and they came out 15 minutes later (we'd now been there for 45 minutes) and while the tops of the plates looked cleaner, the bottoms were still covered in food. I've worked in restaurants before and I do a lot of home entertaining. There is zero doubt in my mind that either the dishwasher was broken so they were wiping them off with who know what type of rag back there OR they were so backed up, they were just wiping things down instead of actually washing them.

Upon walking in to white tablecloths and neatly set place settings, I thought this place might have some class and hoped the food would follow suit... I was sorely disappointed.

The service here is very curt. I can usually overlook sub par service if the food compensates. Unfortunately, in this case...it did no such thing. The food here is just bland and boring. I received overcooked pasta in a flavorless vodka sauce with some sweet italian sausage. My dining companion had a similar opinion of his dish which was the pasta special of the day. The only thing that was enjoyable was the Mozzarella La Baia... though it is pretty difficult to mess up slicing a ball of mozzarella, a tomato, and some roasted red pepper and slapping basil on top. Even here, the tomato was not ripe. I was, for the first time, mad at how bad the food was for the price. Better pasta can be had at most ordinary pizza shops for half the price.

I was very surprised to see that most of the people that joined us in the dining room that evening had made reservations!

If you're thinking about going here, don't. Go to one of the many, far better Italian BYOs this city has to offer. Off of the top of my head I can think of: Popolino, Il Cantuccio, Modo Mio, Monsu... Each having perfectly executed food, good service, and a far more imaginative menu.

If you for some reason decide to eat here, note that it is cash only. Luckily, we did our homework and were prepared.",2012-04-29 14:18:34

I am contacting you a second time since my first correspondence was not responded to.  My wife and I ordered a hamburger and both came out fine.  However I bit into something hard in the burger breaking my tooth.  I expect that this does not happen often but it did happen to me.  I would also expect that you will be willing to cover my dental expense to have my tooth repaired as it's breakage was a direct effect of an improperly prepared food item. Please contact me at...

We will see if this generates a reply.

The issue occurred when the attendant came to my home and I was not there but my housekeeper let then in.  This was not unusual.  I aloud this as it was convenient.  I eventually received a bill for services totaling in excess of $230.00.  My usual bill was $90.00.  I call the office and the clerk told me that was an error.  I only owed the $90.00.  I paid them $90.00.  The next phone call I received from Holpers was them informing me I was being sent to collections.  I called and explained that the office clerk told me I only owed the $90.00.  They denied any conversation with the office clerk.  I finally decided it wasn't worth the argument; after all I was a long standing client.  I then sent in the rest of the amount owed.  I recently noticed a filing on my credit report from them concerning this.  Apparently they did send it to collections even after I paid them.

-ATSXejZxvARvSijDm1WsA,FS0AvNrtigD-F3zdYp9YxQ,E1Ip-KoFvwRPjTslL2pDpg,1.0,21,0,1,"I originally wrote a review about this company at the beginning of our lease, and figured I would update it now that we've moved out. If you read my original review, I was not very impressed with Invitation Homes. Long story short, we had a problem with pest control since the day we moved in. We asked them numerous times to take care of the bugs. This problem was never resolved. We had pest control come out regularly, and on one occasion, they found a massive ant hill underneath the kitchen island. The island was not secure to the floor AT ALL, and when he moved the island, there was a huge ant hill underneath it. This was one of the sources, but it still did not stop the ants. I literally went the entire year wearing shoes. This is not an exaggeration. I wore flip-flops the entire time I lived there, other than to sleep and shower; that is how nasty the house was. I mentioned this to the company, but they didn't fix it, and I doubt they did for the next resident - my apologies to whoever rents this house after us. Anyway, there were many things wrong with the house that I mentioned in my first review. Please feel free to read.

Anyway, we actually moved out a month early and switched to one of their competitor companies.  We spent 3 days cleaning every inch of that house to insure we would get as much of our security deposit back as possible. 

I did the pre-move out inspection and I won't mention any names, but the guy walked around and told me everything looked great. I asked him if there was anything he saw that I needed to do in order to get most of my deposit back (because I wasn't going to get the carpets cleaned, so I knew I would get hit for that). He told me it looks great and I seemed to do everything that needed to be done and there should be no issue. He mentioned that I needed to take down the satellite dish from Direct tv from the roof, power wash the house, and change the shower head because of calcium build up. I came back later, removed the satellites, fixed the shower head, did everything he said - other than power washing and cleaning carpets - there were only three rooms that had carpets.

When we got the security deposit back I was in shock - we didn't even get close to 50% back. I emailed the lady asking why because they didn't send me a breakdown of the charges. She told me they did mail it and I should receive them shortly. After almost a week, I still didn't receive them. I emailed two different people and called another and no one would respond to me as to why I hardly got any money back. Finally someone emailed me the breakdown of the charges, and a few days later i received a breakdown in a mail which was mailed out much later than they said it was. Probably wasn't till after I started complaining that they mailed it. 

They charged me a late fee for the rent - mind you, i tried to pay my rent on time but their tenant portal was down for days. I have numerous emails with an employee and i contacted customer service trying to find out how to pay my rent. the lady told me to keep trying, and if it still doesn't work, mail the check to the office by the 3rd and i would not be charged a late fee. I have all of this proof in emails saying I would not be charged, but I still was. They charged me for ""urine stains"" on the toilet seat and stated they had to buy new seats (I cleaned the toilets before we left) and the shower head for calcium build up. They charged me for the blinds that were already broken when we moved in. They charged me $200 for painting the doors and trim in the house. All of the charges were absurd.

I actually had a friend of ours who rents from IH go look at the house afterwards. They were considering renting the home. We told them DO NOT RENT IT, but they still wanted to look at it anyway. We asked them to look for the things we were charged for. They came back and said that they were not going to rent it because of the amount of ants everywhere, it was dirty and looked like they didn't clean the house, other than what we did to it. They said it looked like nothing was done, no painting was done, nothing was replaced - the blinds, toilet seats, shower head. With that being said, we disputed the charges. I emailed the lady asking if they actually did those things or did they just charge me for them? We ended up getting some more money back for those charges after we disputed them. Unfortunately did not get the $55 back for the late fee. 

Some people may not be fortunate enough to have someone they know look at the house after ""work has been done to it"" so please check these things and take plenty of pictures before you move out because these people will try to charge you and take advantage of every little thing they can. Out of all the companies I've rented from, this one is by far the worst and the only one that I would not recommend by any means. Document everything you can so you're not taken advantage of.",2017-08-01 14:44:24

So, assuming since someone acknowledged they WOULD help me, I walk over to the to go stand at the front and Wait.

Instead of getting prompt service and a proper Sazerac, I was able to watch the bartender being given free cosmetic samples by another customer; among other things.  There is no professionalism at Ball and Biscuit and very poor bar tending skills; at best.  If your into the ""mocktail"" scene then Ball and Biscuit is for you.  If you are into actual authentic cocktails, with real alcohol pours, go elsewhere.  My original review is below as well:

Overall, The Ball and Biscuit does not represent a cocktail bar, which is what this establishment is supposed to be.  The cocktails are creative but weak when it comes to alcohol content.  Given The Ball and Biscuit is a small space it does get loud; sometimes annoyingly loud at times.  But that is not the main issue.  The behavior of some of the patrons is vulgar and immature which ruins the experience in my opinion.  If I wanted to drink with rowdy, drunk patrons using vulgarities I would go to a college bar.  That is not how mature adults behave; especially in a cocktail bar.",2019-03-23 04:30:47

I, and my friends and family visited this restaurant this evening. We were disappointed in the food ordered, but more importantly, we were absolutely shocked at the behavior of the owner. I was served a dish I did not order. I did ask the server about this, and she said they had run out of the ingredients to make it. Ok- that happens. But, in past experience, I have been notified soon after placing my order, and allowed to choose something else. She said the meatless version of this breaded ravioli (cheese) was available, so I chose that. It arrived after my companions finished their meals. As she placed the plate on the table, she immediately asked if I wanted a carryout container. What I needed was a fork, but that had been removed with the food they had chosen for me. As I now felt very unwelcome I responded, ""Yes"". A server came back with a container, and my bill. Of note, I was told that my entree would be ""comped"", when the replacement meal was brought. The bill didn't reflect this. I was charged the full price for what I originally ordered! I brought this to her attention, and I did state,  that in my opinion, there were so many errors made, that if not soon corrected, could have a negative impact on their business. She left,  and  a man who identified himself as the owner came to our table and said he wanted to know ""What is the problem?"" We informed him of the substitution, and he apologized for the mistake. Before we had a chance to thank him for that unsolicited acknowledgement, he proceeded to tell us that the servers said we were cursing and throwing things. Not true. As we tried to deny this egregious accusation, he continually interrupted us. Clearly, his intent was to create a hostile situation, which we wanted no part of. My husband handed him cash to pay the bill and requested it be rung up so that the change would be given back, but the owner was relentless in his argument. FINALLY, the owner took the money, and a server returned with the change. Nothing was"" comped"", and we paid for the more expensive entree, for which, they did not have the ingredients!!

I questioned if I recieved the correct dish and the server ""proudly"" said yes. I sent it back and asked for nothing in return based upon my appetizer flop and main course debacle. 

My husbands Grilled Salmon Salad arrived with a sliver of over-cooked salmon, again with no flavor. (I guess they dont have salt and pepper in the kitchen). The watered down tomato vinaigrette filled the bowl as did the amount of radishes! He had to desperately salt and pepper and lemon the fish to even make it semi palatable....

At that point... we were both sick to our stomachs... and just paid our tab and will never... (did I say never?),  NEVER will return.

Dear Wings to Go,

On Sunday, September 8th around 11:45am, I went to pick up an order of 20-piece medium wings. I want to give you speciefic insight into my experience:

1. As I waited for my order to be ready, I listened to the man behind the counter bragging to a girl how he and another man beat someone up.

2. When I went to pay, I was told they only take cash, and that I needed to walk 200 yards down to the local WaWa to use their cash machine. I have a serious lung disease, so this wasn't easy.

3. When I got home and opened the wings, they were dry as a bone. There was no sauce on them. I called the store to tell them, and they told me to come back and bring the wings so they could see for themselves that the wings were dry, (As if my ""scheme"" is to go to stores and claim the order is wrong in order to get free food) which was offensive. The man asked if I was local, so I could come back for his ""proof."" I explained that I was not local and couldn't just come back. He seemed very relieved by this and quickly said ""Well, I don't know what to tell you then.""

I understand that we're in an era where we as consumers expect our orders to be wrong and we're surprised and delighted when an order turns out to be correct. Nevertheless, this employee was given a clear opportunity to fix this situation. He was ore focused on ""proof"" than anything else, and he could have said he'd take down my name and number and give me a discount when I returned. (This is how you get someone to return. This is also how you turn a bad situation into positive word of mouth.)

So, that's my experience. If you can help, that would be great. If not, well, I understand that the service of today isn't the service of yesteryear.",2013-09-08 17:09:06

I am not going to argue with these people... I only quoted directly what the chef told me about the 80/20. The chef told me Cassis uses an Olive Oil blend imported from France. 80% Olive Oil / 20% Soy oil. 

If anyone has a soy allergy they should beware because there is this blend in the majority of what they cook. I know this because every time I go there, I can only eat 3 things, the Steak, the burger (which by the way is delicious), and a salad (with virgin olive oil and vinegar on the side). They did have a millet and flax bun, but that quickly disappeared. 

Also incorrect by their remarks, was my last visit- last Thursday. My client and I had to wait for almost an hour for a Cuban sandwich (or something like that for him) and then for me, for the hamburger and a side of Italian broccoli. When my food came to the table (after and hour), I was served a hamburger and a salad (with dressing). I had to send it back because the broccoli was not there. 

I won't lie, the hamburger and the Italian broccoli cooked specially for me was delicious, but it took one hour, and I had to speak to the manager (pull teeth)  to get this done.

Since I grew up in an area dominated by Mediterranean and Arabic food, I was jones-ing for a good experience in hopes of recapturing those great flavors that are not easy to find. 

Unfortunately, my experience here left me with only the aroma (suddenly ironic) of those flavors since I never saw a menu or a server after sitting for 15+min. 

A few observations though:
1. This restaurant is in an exceeding odd location. It appears to be in the lobby of an apartment complex where you wouldn't even thin of finding a restaurant, let alone other retail sites. 
2. They were busy, which appears to be a good sign for the quality of the food. 
3. For lunch service, they are severely understaffed. I only saw two people working the dining area. One appeared to be the owner and the other his wife or daughter. The owner was also running the register and handling carry out orders, leaving the patrons mostly unattended. 

In restaurants, I typically prefer to be left to enjoy my meal, but here I never even saw my server. The owner directed me to seat myself. He acknowledged were I sat by saying he'd be right back, but never came. I received no menu, no water and no utensils  (which must have been the omen that I want going to eat anyway). In exasperation, I finally got up and left. On my way out the for, the owner did make an effort to apologize and keep me in the building.

We were in town for a graduation, the entire group wanted to go out to eat for the occasion.  This was one of the closest restaurants, so we packed up the group and headed over in several cars - party of 20 please.  
WHY colleges insist on having graduation on Mother's Day, I will never understand.  As if the crowds would not be plentiful enough, graduation is thrown on top and just makes it uber messy.  I go up to the host station to let them know that we had a very large group, completely understood if we had to be split up, and was braced for a wait.  We were told that we would have to wait about 45 minutes, the group could be seated together.  I turned around, looked about and figured that the place must be a LOT alrger than it looked, there are a TON of folks who will need to flow in and out if we were getting 45 minutes.  Sat down, talked to a bunch of friendly folks and slowly started to realize that the opportunity to have a true wait time was slipping away.  My hubs went to the seafood house next door (also owned by Drago's, but MUCH MUCH better, the only bright spot in what turned into a very bleek day) and purchased some steamed shrimp for the group to snack on prior to our meal.  
After 2 hours, we were finally called to be seated.  All seemed to start to go as well as possible with such a large group at this point.  We were split into 2 tables of 10.  6 of the 10 folks at our table all decided to split the large seafood platter, 3 ordered their own full meals, one was only able to order soup (gumbo) due to some recent dental surgery.  The individual who ordered GUMBO was later misunderstood to have said COMBO.  The restaurant brags and boasts that there is SO MUCH food on the very large seafood platter (~$60) that the combo plate was placed on the end of the tabe with the seafood platter, so no one ever noticed that it was 'extra' food.  (I will make mention that this group frequents a place in Atlanta called Bay Breeze that can teach this place a thing or 10 about HUGE serving sizes)  First, we were confused about why a person who only ordered overpriced ($9) gumbo was charged for a full meal ($16), eventually we figured out what the issue was, we explained the honest mistake to the waiter who had the owner come over.  She showed her behind.  She claimed she was the owner/manager, but I refuse to believe that a person who has achieved such an accomplishment would behave this way in a completely full dining room.  Several of the patrons overheard the manner in which she went off on me and asked me about the treatment on our way out, so could this possibly hurt her in the long run?  
I pulled the server to the side and explained to him that I was initially impressed with his performance, but after this - it was quite obvious that he had no issue with throwing us under the bus to save face.      

Parking sucks.  The manager/owner is a bully, her own employees are afraid to stand up to explain a mistake to her.  The fish had no flavor.  The portions are really not as generous as they claim.  There is no reason why the fries are as soggy as they are.  The cole slaw is disgusting.  The wait is ridiculous and the host needs lessons in communicating wait times if they are consistently as busy as everyone claims.

He near-shouted at me, ""if you're not going to all be getting FOOD AND DRINKS, you better go to the bar"". The bar wasn't even an option because it was crowded. He was very dismissive and condescending. His attitude was very much ""get these twenty-somethings out of my face and go black out on the other side."" 

Mind you, the bar is relatively busy, but it's a cold rainy weekday in December. I have been to MUCH busier restaurants any night of the week that maintain integrity in their process.I explained to him that I wanted a TABLE to EAT FOOD, and not without giving us a hard time for our friend who had not yet arrived, he took our names down. I wasn't even actually sure that he was giving us a table because his attitude was completely dismissive and his response to me asking to take a name down was just an eye roll. This guys attitude would be more appropriate in a Manhattan four star restaurant than an irrelevant Doylestown dump. 

I was getting pretty pissed off by his attitude but was like, okay, he's just a sassy old dude having a bad night... Perhaps I'm taking this too personally. As I'm having this thought, I watch him shamelessly talk to one of the women on the staff in such a nasty way that it makes me physically uncomfortable. This is what crossed the line from ""this guy is rude"" to ""other people need to know how horrible this experience is"".

After 15 minutes or so we get a table. Our waitress confirms we are of age and gets our orders, then awkwardly has to to come back because her manager (obviously the same guy) insisted that he double check our IDs. He took our cards for at least 10 minutes which was very strange but honestly the least problematic occurrence of the night. Good thing our waitress was a total sweetheart which helped the vibe.

I would only go back to Pocos if I was deeply confused or in a depressive state and desperately trying to get f***rd up on half-priced margaritas. Food is fine. Drinks are fine. The weird container you serve salsa out of is very unappealing. It's not an enjoyable experience. 

If you do decide to go, make sure to go for the side salad. (pictured)",2018-12-21 04:03:32

When we arrived, the hostess opened the door and rudely said ""we're closed"" and we politely said ""please there's a few minutes before 10pm close"" and she said in an extremely nasty voice ""no, the doors locked, were closed!"" and my boyfriend just stood there and said ""oh man, we drove a really far way"" and she rudely yelled with a frown on her face ""no sir!! We're closed!"" And looked at me and said ""Get him! Get him"". I completely understand that the restaurant was very close to closing time so we anticipated this but the way this hostess handled it was extremely unprofessional and rude. How hard is it to be polite and nicely say ""we're closed"" when you are in fact in the hospitality business! I am geared towards thinking she was so nasty because my boyfriend has a thick accent and she was being racist. This is not the way to treat customers. We have been going to on the borders for many years and never ever have we been treated so poorly.

There were 3 people manning the entire bar area and serving the entire restaurant....which means serving, preparing and tidying up: one man, 2 women.  They were exhausted and it was only 6:30 pm.
The waitresses were pushing orders like food was free and the restaurant was packed (it wasn't).  We could not understand the problem to say the least.  
The poor guy attending us could not give us his attention as he seemed to be so busy caring for everyone else while the 2 ladies did ??who knows??  Twice the floor manager popped into the bar area to prep several plates and did so without washing his hands nor putting on gloves (hope you didn't get sick from those oysters he prepped you!!).
Anyways, one of the girls made our pan roasts in the assembly station of her preference which was well away from where we sat and those next to us, who also were there for the 1st time and who were waiting in anticipation for the visual.  
While the food was good and we managed to beg for another piece of bread (but could have used more) we opted not to tip, which left a very sour note on our palettes.  It's unfortunate for those not to be compensated due to obvious management problems but se la ve!

So a bedroom set that I ordered in May will now hopefully but probably not delivered in SEPTEMBER! Seriously, what business operates like this! 

    So first, my 5K brand new bedroom set was delayed from delivery for three weeks because the box springs to my iComfort mattress was on back order. Ok. Then, when they finally do come for delivery, they only have the box springs, the mattress, the slats, and the entertainment chest. I call them to find out where the rest of my bedroom set is, once again the rest of my bedroom set is on back order. Two more weeks go by, they come for delivery! Guess what?! The have the dresser, but no mirror, the headboard and the footboard, but none of the support legs to actually assemble the bed without it being broken once layed upon, and they don't have both end tables?!?!?! This is getting comical at this point. I'm about ready to have them come pick up the half they took over a month to deliver!

IF you have no choice, like your boss says ""join me for dinner at The Pelican Club"" or your Mother-in-Law insists just make sure you're seated in the middle dining room so you can hear the conversation at your table. The bar and the last dining room areas can get very loud with the stone (tiled) floors. Also, when looking at the menu, go simple. Some of the dishes are too many flavors and the star of the dish is overwhelmed. Like the Cioppino. My husband loved the flavor of the sauce and the seafood was cooked just right but the pasta was cheesy and a dish in itself. Cheese and Cioppino do not go well together, there's really no need for it. He also had the Tuna Poke. The tuna was the star but covered in guacamole. Way over the top too much avocado. There was a nice basket of focaccia placed on our table but the bread was too over-warmed, too dark and crusty on the outside as if it had been in a warming drawer all day.  My scallop stuffed artichoke had me dreaming of an artichoke, perfectly steamed leaves with maybe a little garlic butter accenting the meaty leaves with some chopped scallops mixed into the garlic butter as I pull off the leaves. (Sounds good, right?) But what was served was a plate of four artichoke leaves with a scallop on each leaf and an inch (maybe 1/2"") wide slice of the heart with tiny dice of tomato. Hmmmm, Ok, there were 4 big scallops but totally over killed the artichoke. My entree had to be better, right? How can you go bad with the rack of lamb?! I'll tell you. Bread and batter the rack and burn the breading, that's how! Total over kill and total waste of a rack of lamb. I scraped off an inch thick breading of two rib chops and could not continue.

First, I was so happily surprised that two bottles of water and two ice cream bars were in my refrigerator. Problem is they were half eaten and dripping in the refrigerator. I cleaned it. If it was a gift, not good as I am a type 1 diabetic. Can you say diabetic coma?

Second, the room smelled like two hookers wrestling. The room spray was so horrid. It reminded me of a brothel with that sweet/spicy perfume smell. I was looking for a fat woman asking for $50 and to choose a woman. 

Third, can you please match the height of the desk chair with the desk?  I felt like a midget fighting to get into a SUV without a step ladder. 

Fourth, while I appreciate energetic employees, I had to pay a bellhop $3 to just leave me alone and go away. 
Fifth, the furniture. Was this the Baghdad Marriott or the Philadelphia Marriott? Take a look at the desk. Did my grandmother donate it? The carpet design had me begging for a Xanax. The walls were papered with a design Charles Manson would just simply adore. In fact the carpet/wall paper combo was probably taken from Shitty Homes Digest. 

Sixth, can we please add some light to the bathroom. This is not particular to this property, but most Marriott properties. I do not travel with night vision headsets from the military. 

Seventh, who made the bed? After a few hours of self therapy and calming techniques, I tried to go to bed. It was like someone was watching me and laughing. The sheets would not come over my beautiful abs. I had to use all the strength I had to pull the sheets over me. Again, I'm not Peter Dinklage, although he is a great actor. 

Eighth, $9.95 for one night of internet!!!!  Are you kidding. I have never had to pay for Wifias a Marriott Gold member. And it did not say that it was a charge on the website. I sucked it up and tried to connect, BUT THE CONNECTION DID NOT WORK. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a nice Filipino ladywho helped me connect to Wifi. Was I in Uganda?

This was our first time coming here. When we walked in around 4 on a Sunday no employees were around to greet us, we had to walk to the back of the restaurant and wait for someone to come out and tell us to seat ourselves. We sat down and the waitress came over and gave us two different menus (she did explain they were in the process of changing the menu). There were two waitresses on the shift that day and there were two other families dining at the time we came in. After awhile our waitress came back out took our order for food and this is where things got weird. We got our app pretty quick but had to ask for silverware twice. We also asked for waters that took nearly an hour to be brought to us. I ordered a platter with Mac and cheese and potato salad so did my boyfriend. After waiting about 30 mins after ordering the food the first employee comes over and asks me if I ordered turkey wings I politely said no. I'm assuming one of the cooks came out next and again asked me if I ordered turkey wings, again I said no and he asked me if I was sure. I'm not sure if it was a miscommunication between staff members but I was confused as to why they were insisting I ordered turkey wings. I get my platter with no Mac and cheese I asked where it was and the waitress says ""oh we're out for the day"" yet that wasn't disclosed to us when we ordered or anytime after that. My boyfriend waited over an hour for his platter and by that time we just wanted to go. The two other families there also had issues with their orders/checks. The customers who were picking up their food had issues with not just wait time but again a customer ordered Mac and cheese and it was not told to him on the phone that they were out. The kitchen staff and waitresses were arguing with eachother loud enough that the customers could hear. By the time we finally got our waters we ordered in the beginning we were getting our check. Multiple staff members did say that they were implementing a new system and that's where the miscommunication came from. The majority of the staff wasn't outright rude or anything but they were definitely not very personable. The owner did come out and apologize and he was very sweet.

The store has problems in several areas:
Flow.  At times your customers are expected to order at the grill.  At times order at the cashier.  I've stood in front of the grill when expected to order there - indeed the sign said so - and been directed to the cashier.  The cashier has directed me to the grill - despite a sign saying otherwise.

Food delivery speed.  It should never take 55 minutes for a turkey sandwich to reach a customer after he orders it.

Restocking.  Certain products existed early on but were never restocked.

Form of payment acceptance - it is NEVER ok to let a vendor take your POS system's credit card connection down at lunch time.  It's even worse when your customers' only option is a $3 per transaction no-armed bandit of an ATM.  The same cashier that indifferently told me cards didn't work didn't care too much that I'd just paid a fee for the privilege of paying for my 55 minute lunch.

Prices.  Do you comparison shop anywhere other than Whole Foods?

Employees.  It's a family business.  I don't think you get to work there if you're not related.  The employees aren't engaged or motivated for the most part.  The service experiences I've had there have been really indifferent.

By the time you DO get food, it's excellent.  It should be, you paid a premium for it!  But all of the other potential problems overshadow the whole experience.

On the third week I made sure that I would get a response, and the supervisor finally gave me an amount. The amount that they wanted me to pay to install the two items, was insane. For the capacitor, they told me it as $260 to buy the part and replace it, when the part only cost no more than $15. I know this because I had already purchased it, but they wanted me to buy it from them, so they can charge me both arms and legs for it. The EZ trap was surprisingly less. It was only $179, but I looked for it and should only be around $60.After hearing the price they wanted me to pay I told them, ""no thanks,"" and I looked for another company on Yelp.

Big mistake. Both recent orders were wrong when they came or things missing. First week they gave us a credit. This week just forget it. I ordered a cheese steak hoagie w/ onion rings. Got a steak w/ onions only and the soggiest onion rings ever. My wife got a Mexican thing that she said was tasteless. The Greek salad had a little feta on it and a couple ""black"" olives and no pepperoncini like it used to. No romaine either. I live walking distance from there so there is no reason for lukewarm delivery or soggy rings. My family had restaurants for 40 years.

I arrived first and grabbed a table.  Once the waiter came, I ordered a drink.  About 5 minutes later, the drink arrived.  It seemed like a pretty long time for a drink to come, but maybe I am just impatient?  The other two people came and it took about the same time for them as well.

The waiter was very nice and quick, so I am guessing any delays were on the bar's end.  Once we ordered our appetizers, they came out in a couple of minutes.  The same can be said for main course as well.  It came out super fast and was plated very well for family-styled eating.

Once the food hit the table, we were in awe.  What should I try first?  What about this?  What about that? Everything looked delicious and nicely presented.  

The first thing I tried were the ribs.  The meat was so tender, but the flavor was really weird.  It tasted like a cigarette and was ""too smokey.""  I even put some of their BBQ sauce on it, but it couldn't hide the overwhelming smokey flavor.  The second meat I had was the Beef Brisket.  I was melt in your mouth good.  A toothless baby wouldn't have trouble chewing this meat.  It was the 2nd best thing I ate last night.  My favorite part of the meal was the Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread.  It was sweet, nicely textured and had a lil kick to it.

All of the other food we ordered was ""OK"" or not that good.  We had the chicken (had chicken just as good at Boston Market), the pulled pork (good, but nothing special), beans (Bush's baked beans are better), cole slaw (not too sure it was cole slaw, had to check the menu again to see if they gave us the correct item), German potato salad (pretty good), mac n' cheese (no flavor whatsoever), and the brisket fries (pretty good).

With all of our pent-up hype, we were expecting something so much better than what we got.  I am not saying that Percy St. is awful, it just wasn't as good as I thought it should have been.

In my personal humble opinion, I think that Famous Dave's is not only better for your buck, but better in general.  I appreciated PSB, but I've had better BBQ at a ""chain.""",2014-12-18 20:31:31

First off, the food: It was just meh, okay. Most recently, I got the shrimp quesadilla with chicken tortilla soup lunch special. Well, something that kinda weirded me out about this was that I was led on to believe that I had a choice of different soups because that is what the menu said. When I told our waiter that ""I guess I'll have the chicken tortilla soup"" while looking at the menu for their other soups, he replied, ""Yeah, that's really the only soup we have."" WHAT?!?! Keep in mind that they have an entire section devoted to ""Soups"" Yet, there is only one soup listed. The other ""soup"" is chili. I'm sorry, but chili is not soup unless it's super greasy, and that's just gross. Please offer more soups on your menu please so we have more options to choose from when deciding what soup we want to go with our meal or just say that it comes with the chicken tortilla soup .

Moving on, the food was not that great. I've had better shrimp quesadillas. To be honest, I've had better plain and simple cheese quesadillas for that matter. Oh and that chicken tortilla soup was probably one of the worst chicken tortilla soups I've ever had. Not to mention, that most chicken tortilla soups have a reddish-brown color. This one was DARK BROWN, and it only slightly tasted like chicken tortilla soup.

Other experiences we've had coming here included my mom ordering some sort of taco salad that didn't come with any meat in it. I don't know if I've ever heard of a taco salad without some meat in it. I'm pretty sure they forgot to put it in there. Oh and for a Mexican restaurant, they have one of the worst margaritas I've ever had. Although, I heard their other drinks are pretty good.

Overall, their service is pretty good. If I come back here, it's because it's not far from my house and I'm probably grabbing a drink with a friend or something because the atmosphere is REALLY NICE. But I won't come here to eat. There are way too many good Mexican restaurants in this city to waste it on mediocre wanna-be Mexican food.",2014-03-18 16:41:45

On the other end of Main Street, we found La Roca, our next best Mexican option. We started off with with a round of margaritas which were excellent. The problems started when we placed an order for food. 

Our order was relatively simple - two orders each of chicken and shrimp tacos and one order of chips and guacamole along with a side of elotes or Mexican corn. After about thirty minutes, we checked with the waiter if everything was ok. They apologized because they'd messed up our order and said they'd waive 25% off our bill. After an hour, our food still wasn't ready. It took our waiter not one , not two but three reminders to bring tacos to our table. This time, they apologized again and promised us that they'd give us an extra round of drinks, on the house and waive the charges for two entrees. 

When the check was brought to us, both sets of entrees were still on it. We were charged for a pitcher of margarita which we never ordered, a guacamole order that we never received and not an inkling or the promised discount for drinks or food. It then took us two more attempts , yes not one but two more attempts, to correct the check. Over two hours at La Roca, our group had two tacos and two margaritas.

The request was as follows; ""can we have the honey and walnut encrusted goat cheese on the baby spinach arugula salad instead of the regular goat cheese"". The reply was ""sure"". I also ordered two glasses of wine, the cheese board (comes with charcuterie meats per description, but non was present on the board except duck pate), exotic sautéed mushrooms and the buffalo tacos.
The cheese board which should have been out in 5 minutes or not long after the wines arrived showed up with the mushrooms after a good 15-20 minutes.  No sign of my toddlers fries.  Do they not teach their servers to serve kids first?  As you can imagine my little boy got very restless and was in everything, sugar packs, salt shaker you name it.  I'd think it is common sense to serve kids first.
Then came out the main dishes.  My son's fries were the last to come out.  The food was nothing spectacular but pretty good considering it is bar food.  I'd avoid the mushrooms, it is not as good as pictured, swimming in soy sauce with no hint of mushroom taste (and nothing exotic about portobello and shiitake) What finally did it for me was the bill.  On there was the honey and walnut encrusted goat cheese and the baby spinach arugula salad charged at full price each.  I expected an up charge for modification but not this ripoff.  When I questions the waiter she said I did not clarify and did nothing.
So basically I got a baby spinach and arugula salad with a $12 up charge for the honey glaze & walnuts on the goat cheese which was already included in the salad!!",2015-12-20 03:38:11

I heard one of the servers explain to a table that they were short staffed and the  food would be a little while. We should have walked out then and there but continued on to our booth. 
My partner asked for hot chocolate and water but they could only give her water because their microwave was out. Excuse me? No hot water tap on the coffee machine? That was the first mistake. I heard the same server explain to a different table that they only had 2 cooks and the food was well on its way. Now, mind You, it's a diner. I ordered sausage and eggs with their banana bread (they were out and offered banana pancakes and I took them up on it) it's not hard to put together. It came out cold and bland and they didn't even try. I tried to send the food back but the server suggested that I needed food in my belly. I tried again to no avail.

We got there at 3pm and it was already considered dinner time (that was fine though, my group decided to pay that price). We were seated pretty quickly which was nice. 
We filled our ticket out (appetizers, two lunch long rolls and 6 dinner rolls). They never brought out one of the appetizers (the miso soup). When they brought the rolls out, the two lunch rolls were hand rolls and not long rolls. We got some of the rolls but were missing some still so after a good while we asked the status for that and the ticket so we could see what all we were still missing and to see if we maybe put hand rolls down instead of long rolls. She advised us that the ticket was already thrown and if we want more, to just file another ticket out.
At this point, I received one of the three rolls I wanted and the two people with me were both missing one each. We decided to order 3 more rolls and just cut our losses for the rest. When they brought that one out, it had 2 of the rolls on there but missing the one I ordered. 
The waitress never checked in on us throughout the two hour experience we were there and I only ever got one roll the whole time. They at least made that somewhat alright by just charging me for the roll rather than the all you can eat dinner price. 
Even when the waitress went onto break and told the other waitress what was going on with her tables, I overheard her say ""that table? I'm not sure what they are doing. I don't know if they want more sushi or if they are done..."" well that maybe was because she never really checked and asked.
Could have been an off day for the business or for the waitress (maybe both) but it was definitely not my favorite experience...I won't be going there for awhile honestly but hope people get better experiences than I did.

When the associate that helped us approached him about speaking with us, this guy did not come out to speak with us and instead spoke very 'loudly' toward the associate that was attempting to retrieve him for us.

I verbalized that we ware a bit uncomfortable with the way he was speaking to us, he responded by yelling at us further and asked ""how do you WANT me to speak to you??!!""  We pointed out that he seemed very defensive without cause and he proceeded to sit on the floor, pretzel style, and asked ""is this BETTER??!!!"".

It is very hard for me to write this updated review since I wanted so badly to give local provisions the opportunity to get things right and assumed that my bad experience was just a fluke. First of all, the primary restaurant, ""Pearl on the Grove"" is am amazing place and while this is an extension of that establishment, it is nowhere close to the quality. 

Local Provisions boast the high quality of local farmers food and the prices reflect this. Unfortunately it seems that the aquaponic salads that are provided and fruits are hit and miss. I have gone and had amazing salads and other times (most of the time) I received wilted, black, and excessively old salad. It was not fresh and was sitting for some time. For a small salad priced over $11, I expected more. 

On another visit I waited over 60 minutes for a hamburger; there were only 6-10 people at the restaurant . When the burger finally came, they forgot the $2 bacon that I paid for. While the waitress was apologetic and offered a beer, this was one of many customer service issues  and reduced quality management that seems to plague this place.

If you want a sandwiche that ranges from amazing to sub par..roll the dice an visit this place. I will stick to the beer (if I go back) or visit the Mexican place next door that has always been consistently good, fresh, and delicious.  

The only thing that seems good about Local Provisions is the  modern, trendy, atmosphere and the craft beers that they offer. The food has the opportunity to be amazing, but I think that there needs to be improved management in the kitchen.",2015-12-30 12:38:35

The waitress didn't know the specials and said that they probably didnt have them anymore anyway, and if this was the case they probably would mix whatever they could find in kitchen. Very bizarre. My husband ordered a Texan egg burguer (median cooked) and got an overdone no eggs and almost no cheese burguer, thankfully the waitress came back asking if he would like some cheese on his burguer. 

My impression of the place is that the employees were not trained. We could see their good will and intentions, but they looked like  someone without any experience serving another one. Additionally, the place looked without any supervision, consequently, everybody was acting as if they were in their own home preparing food for somebody else. You can have a very relaxed environment between the employees, which I think is very healthy, but it was a little too much for a diner environment.

Unacceptable Attire: The following attire is never acceptable on the first or second floors of the League House: jeans, denim wear, tee shirts, athletic wear, tank, halter, or jogging tops, untucked shirts, wrinkled clothing, shorts, baseball caps, sneakers, extremely casual or beach footwear.

Members and guests staying at the Inn of the League or using the Fitness Center may enter and leave the League House in attire that would not otherwise comply with the rules of the House Committee only to go to or leave from the Fitness Center or the overnight rooms only by using the Sansom Street entrance and the elevators to and from the overnight rooms.

Saturday and Sunday: Business casual attire is acceptable on Saturday until 5:00pm and all day Sunday in the Café throughout the year.""

The only phrase that comes to mind is ""Attire Nazis""

I was denied being able to use my breakfast vouchers, because I didn't bring any attire to meet the above criteria.  I was on a work trip and needed access to the business center, forget it, denied, Nice.  I was directed to another computer that I could use.  I was unable to print from this computer so it was useless.

Additionally I prefer to take the stairs to the elevator.  That is not allowed.  You must take the stairs, I wonder if they enforce this when there is a fire as well...

The WiFi was spotty at best but the wired connection is quick...  Except that they block your access to certain websites, thanks for that. I love it when people make decisions for me because it must be in my best interest, yay!

The rooms are quite nice.  Spacious and have the feel of the turn of the century.  I really liked the rooms, quiet and solidly built.  Not your average drywall and cookie cutter construction found in most new hotels.

Was surprised the the TV service isn't HD.  Nice flat screens, but the picture in SD does not do them justice.

When they say ""Convenient parking at the Midtown Garage, 1415 Sansom Street, located directly across from the entrance to the Inn.""  What they mean is that you can pay at the parking garage across the street at a slightly discounted rate:(

I can see that there would be a certain type of person that would like to stay here, see grandparents, but it was definitely not for me.  I would never stay here again.",2011-06-14 00:49:48

That's fine, but when I asked the owner or manager (???) for assistance, he was totally unhelpful with my request.  Instead of saying that he would check his distributors for the color and fabric I wanted, he told me to find the shirt myself and bring it in.  I told him that the whole point of working with a local, small business was to have them help me source the t-shirt.  I have no idea who distributors are or where to look.  He just looked at me dumbfounded.  He may not have been able to find what I was looking for, but I was disappointed that he didn't even want to try.  As a business person who deals with t-shirts, manufacturers, and distributors all day, he clearly has more knowledge of this than me.  If I wanted to do all of that work myself, I would have just contacted one of the larger, online t-shirt companies.  But, I wanted to support a local, small business.  At any rate, the mediocre service forced me to go with a national company and my neighborhood t-shirt store lost a decent sized order.",2013-09-04 14:11:49

I went here on June 12th, 2011 after getting rained out of the Zydeco Festival. I did some research before coming to N'awlins and Coops had decent reviews. Well let me tell you....EVERYTHING about the place was just TERRBILE!

1. The Environment. The place is TINY...so don't let the line outside fool you. It can only seat 20 ppl so us tourist have to wait. LET ME TELL U...its not worth it. Its dark, dingy and really a biker bar that serves food. NOT a RESTURANT. As evidence o the huge pool table in the back taking up space where they could put seating....obviously the focus isn't food.

2. The Service: Well that's just NON EXISTENET. Some dude feeling his hosting authority tells me and my friend to wait outside. 2 minutes later we are seated, tossed two menus and the guy disappears again. I never hear, welcome, thank you, or even how you doin' . Nothing!

3. Most importantly, the Food: YUCKY-O BUCKY-O. I got the Taste plate and there was not one thing I could stomach without some re-working on my part, literally. The gumbo outright sucked. It had more okra and green onion in it than anything. The jambalaya contained watery rice, the red beans + rice needed a lot of seasoning, I only at the fried chicken after also taken a hit of salt to the head (yes...like a shot)....and the Shrimp Creole was just  'eh.
The food was so bad I didn't even send it back and request something new. I literally ran out of this place as fast as I could. Between the food and the piss poor service I'm amazed so many ppl rate this place so well.
***Small disclaimer: My cousin who is a native ate here a few hours earlier than I and claimed her food was ""well seasoned."" However, as for me, NEVER AGAIN! A place that cannot produce consistent quality food is just not worth visiting.",2011-06-14 15:55:08

Since I live in the South end this was a far trek to go for pizza, but I heard some good things so I decided to check it out with some friends. We decided to split a large pep and cheese. Not a very exciting choice, but it's a classic. It was decent enough. I wish they would also invest in larger wine glasses. I felt like I was drinking out of a teacup.

The best part of the whole experience happens on the left side of the restaurant so try to get a table on that side. You can actually see into the kitchen and the cooks are tossing up the dough like you see on TV. It was very cool and distracted me from the table's conversation many times.

It was a quite night, a weeknight, and we were one of the only tables in the place.  The food was, in all honesty, wonderful, but our service was awful.  From the outset, our waiter was extremely pretentious and pretension gave way to condescension when I turned down his suggestion of a $130 bottle of wine.  The rest of the night went downhill from there, and my wife and I could not get out of there fast enough after finishing our entrees because of the overbearing and snooty waitstaff.  I used to wait tables and generally tip at least 20% and I was on the edge of stiffing our guy (I didn't, though).  I am sure people have had wonderful experiences there, but we've never been back and have heard complaints from others when we tell the story.  Again, I apologize if this seems unfair, but those are the breaks.  Again, the food was really good, and my compliments to the chef.  The duck confit was the best I've had this side of Paris.

- The fire alarm went off a total of 7 times throughout the concert. After the 2nd alarm went off they turned off all the smoke machines but apparently that did little. The speakers turn off when the fire alarms go off, which disturbed the concert a lot.

+ The bathrooms were very clean. I was honestly shocked and impressed how clean the men's bathroom was.

- The security guards really did not care how rowdy and obnoxious the extremely drunk people in the venue were. At some point a group of drunk people got up and blocked our view of the show. They were also falling over and jumping over the metal bike rack and no one seemed to care.

+ The staff was very friendly, even complimented my hair :)

- The seating arrangement was aweful. They had a general admission pit area right in front of the front row seats. The front row seats were mainly blocked by a large bike rack. This didn't really bother me since I'm tall, but for shorter people this was definitely an issue.

Now my wife and I have been servers at various restaurants for the past 6 years each, we are pretty easy to please because we understand the struggle. But we would have not just said sorry to everyone and made excuses. We would have made it right. They should have offered some coffee, or a muffin or something to appease us as we wait. Nothing at all was offered, no comps, no coffee, nothing. All we got were half hearted apologies. Our server said that the owner (who was cooking) told her not to stare at him and wait on the food anymore or else he would send her home. After the food finally came, the owner came out and asked all the other 10 people in the restaurant how they are doing except us. It kind of felt like he was trying to ignore us.

We were in Santa Barbara for the weekend and thought we'd have brunch at Hungry Cat, given that we've enjoyed our meals at their sister location in Hollywood.  Sadly, we were mistaken.  

I ordered the frittata, which was described as a chorizo frittata.  Well, I'll be damned if there was a single piece of chorizo in the frittata!  (A neigboring diner also bemoaned the lack of chorizo in HIS frittata, so this was not a lone incident of missing chorizo.)  Moreover, it was smeared with sour cream--a fact my waitress failed to mention!  When I brought the issue to the wait staff's attention (by very nicely observing that the frittata may not have been accurately described), she steadfastly maintained that there WAS indeed chorizo in the frittata--just not chunks of chorizo in casing, more like ""essence"" of chorizo--and offered to give us a free drink.  While I enjoyed my second beer, it would have been better to actually get what I ordered.  Certainly, if the frittata had been described as an invisible chorizo frittata, I wouldn't have ordered it.  

Meanwhile, my bemused BF ordered the lobster roll, which is ridiculously overpriced at $22 for a small roll with less than a 1/3 lb of lobster on a plate 2/3 covered with French fries.

We found Serpico it looked modern, a little dark and mysterious so we walked in. We sat at the bar and were greeted very friendly at first by the bartender -he placed 2 glasses of water in front of us and the menu. 

We ordered drinks and once again in Philadelphia another really weak drink my friend once again had to order a double. So the bartender person went over the menu...he loved everything (of course) and said he loved everything prior to working there and of course now he loved everything...but nothing he detailed seemed good or exciting. So we passed and had a few more drinks. He seemed very disgruntled and irritated for the rest of our time there-right after we said no to the food. 

I will say the atmosphere is great here...a little crowded but the modern feel makes up for that. The kitchen is an open kitchen so it is really nice to see what is being created.

The technicians have always been respectful, clean and they have always called ahead. HOWEVER, what makes me very angry is how they completely ignore what their TV commercials claim. I needed to have my furnace repaired. The technician had an 8 hour window to arrive, hence their claim to be ""on time"". He arrived, only to tell me I'd need a part. No problem, except not only did he not have the part, but it also probably wouldn't be in their warehouse. I had to wait an additional 3 days for them to receive it. Wait, don't their commercials say they carry parts on their trucks? GUH? The technician told me that I'd allowed my service contract to lapse and that I should get one again to make sure that never happened again. He also told me that I wouldn't be charged extra ($315, if memory serves) for late and weekend appointments. Don't their commercials claim to not charge extra for odd times? I know they do, because I just saw one!! I did purchase that contract. Just the other day, my air conditioner stopped working. Now, with service contract in hand, I called and they told me that I'd have to wait 4 days for the next available appointment. WHAT? Why did I spend $89 on a service contract? Again, all over their website and on their commercials, they claim to have ""same day service"". Just ridiculous. I canceled that service appointment and called a different local company. They came in less than an hour, determined the issue and repaired it in less than 20 minutes. I will never use Horizon services again.

First, we selected WOB because we were planning on heading over to the Movie Tavern nearby after dinner. We gave ourselves well over an hour for dinner, thinking it would be fine as we were planning on getting an app and a drink. However, that was not the case. We shared with our waiter that we were going to a movie and we wanted to put our food in with the drink. He took our order and after 20 minutes returned (after being flagged down) to tell us the beer was kicked. He then asked what we wanted to order - politely we told him we had already ordered with him 20 minutes ago. Clearly, he had forgotten (which is fine) but it also meant after about 30 minutes our food was not in the system nor did we have a drink. After once again waiting - our waiter nowhere in sight - we asked another staff member for the status of our drinks and food. She brought it to us (it was sitting in the kitchen) and once again no drinks. We were pressed for time and when we got ahold of staff we said just forget the drinks we put in about 45 minutes prior because we were running way too late. Miraculously they found them, again, sitting at the bar. They were brought to the table after we finished our meal, and they were the wrong drinks. Our movie had already started while we waited for the check. The manager offered to comp the drink which was kind, however she brought us over another tables checks... scanned the wrong card... and left it for us to sign. We had to find another staff member to correct this issue because some other table was incorrectly charged. IT WAS A MESS. We rushed out of the restaurant, at this point 20 minutes late to the movie.

IT GETS WORSE:
In doing so, I left my purse on the chair. I hold myself completely accountable for leaving behind my purse. But when I called to ask if they  it I was told by two ladies who worked and closed on Tuesday 10/1 that ""oh we both closed and no purse was found and no purse is here"". I questioned there response as I was certain I left behind my purse, however I thought maybe someone sat at the table may have taken it, etc. With the slight chance it was in my home or misplaced in the car - I tore apart my house. I spent over 3 hours searching as my purse (valuable alone) had valuable belongings including my passport and cash. After searching for my bag and knowing I left it there and questioning the response I got, as it seemed not authentic, I called back WOB one more time. 

This time a nice man answered the phone and I asked him the same questions I asked the two women previously working. He said ""yes, it is sitting right here. I will have it ready when you come in."" 

That is completely unacceptable. I was clearly lied too as my purse was was right in front of the phone. Exactly how I had described it, with a photo ID in the inside. 

Like I said at the start, I am not one to write reviews. But I think it is important for anyone who plans to visit WOB to know that they have untrustworthy staff members with poor service. Again, 1 star for the kind man who helped me with my purse and the other kind man who helped figure out the issue with the wrongly charged card.

With that - I will never be coming back nor will I share any kind words for WOB with others in the community.",2019-10-08 17:40:34

I was CRAVING good, FRESH guacamole last week, so I hit up Yelp for recommendations.  All signs pointed to El Vez and I wanted to bar hop downtown for Happy Hour anyway, so we went.  The decor was cool, I kind of like that the bathroom is downstairs (even though it reminded me of a dungeon) and everyone was relatively friendly.  

When we walked in, it was super busy, so we sat immediately at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  The bartender was pretty busy, so we didn't get tons of attention at first, but its cool...  I didn't really feel like talking anyway.  She took our orders (Ashlei got nachos, I ordered the the Cesar Chavez guacamole), gave us our beers and about five minutes later, Ashlei's nachos come out.  They were pretty decent.  Perfect munchie food, but I wanted guacamole.  I sat patiently, conjuring up some cockamamie story as to why my guac is taking soooooo long!!  ""Maybe they went to Mexico for authentic Oaxaca cheese.  Maybe they're in California picking the freshest of avocados so I can have the ultimate guac experience.  Maybe plankton got a hold of their secret recipe and they're trying to get it back!!"".  Nope.  None of that was true.  I finally asked the bartender about my food and was told ""I put it in, I don't know what they're doing back there"".  After a couple minutes, she went to check and came back and told me that either they forgot or they gave my food to someone else. *le sigh*

Long story short, I no longer wanted my guacamole.  I mean I did, but I didn't (petty, I know).  Our SOLE purpose for going there was so I could get my guacamole fix.  I didn't expect to be leaving out of the restaurant thinking ""I should have just went to Chipotle"".  I was super disappointed...

That would be enough to keep me from going back, but not to write a negative review.  What I really couldn't stand were the aspects of service our waitress could control.  I ordered a cup of soup, which I would think is a clear indication that I'm concerned about price.  She recommended the soup of the day, which was $6.50 for a cup!  Of course I only found that out when I got my check, onto which was tacked a 20% gratuity, which I would not have given because of the failure to inform me of the price difference.  Plus the soup had far too much cheese, which left little room for the soup itself.
The other thing that really bugged me was that once we finally got a table inside, they turned on the A/C!  It was below 40 out, and the whole reason we'd wanted to come in was to warm up.

It was long enough for us to decide on what we were eating and read enough Yelp reviews that we started to consider leaving. (Should have checked Yelp before, like I usually do!)

The waitress came over apologizing. We ordered a soy mocha, a grilled chicken sandwich and the crab quesadilla.

The mocha came out and it tasted like chocolate flavored water. Really gross. I wanted to trade it in for an Iced Tea. We kept looking for our server and she was nowhere to be found. There were only a few tables and it was right during the lunch hour, which should have been our clue that this was a place to avoid. There were employees everywhere but not our server. I finally asked another employee if she could send our server over.

And we waited some more. We were actually deciding to leave when our food came out. So we started eating. My grilled chicken sandwich was good, the fries were good but greasy. My husband thought his crab quesadilla tasted like tuna.

We were almost done with our food when our server finally decided to grace us with her presence. I told her to please take off the barely touched mocha and to just bring the check, which she did.

There's no reason the service should have been that bad, they were not understaffed. There is a reason they were so empty during the Friday lunch hour, and management should take note.

I inquired as to how long it would take for the refund to be returned to my debit card. The cashier stated it should not have gone through but in on HOLD and processed for immediate reversal. WELL IT WAS NOT SO IMMEDIATE ! The refund did not occur for 4 days...so for 4 days, weekend included, I was paralyzed financially! I had bills due on Friday that could not get paid that incurred late fees, could not make groceries, buy gas or eat out even if I wanted to.

The drinks tasted and looked good. The food was similar quality to what you could find in a foodcourt. Was pretty salty and bland. I wouldn't want to eat their food again.

I went in at about 3:15PM not a rush time at all.  There were maybe four tables with people eating when I arrived.  The server took almost 5 minutes to arrive at my table.  She did smile and was friendly enough.  She took my order and said ""I will be right back with your iced tea.

FIVE MINUTES LATER she came with my drink and slaw.  NO biscuits and NO explanation.  Before I could ask, she had walked away and out of the room.  After another 5 minutes, she came through and I called her to my table to ask about the biscuits.  She told me that she was ""waiting for them to finish baking.""  Why didn't she tell me that when she brought my drink?  

After about 10 more minutes, she brought my food.  Dropped in front of me and walked away.  Didn't ask me if I needed anything else or tell me to enjoy....nothing.

I ate my food and about half way through my iced tea glass was empty.  I had not seen my server the entire time. Once again she had disappeared from the room leaving me and two other tables to fend for ourselves.  I saw the other server and asked him to get me a drink refill.  He had to go to the kitchen to get another pitcher of iced tea.  He brought it and filled my glass.

My server NEVER came to the table to ask if everything was alright.  But after I waited another few minutes after finishing my meal, she came and asked if I was ""doing OK.""  She saw the empty dishes and glass and never removed anything from the table.  I asked for my check and she walked away leaving the dirty dishes in front of me.

This is not fine dining and if the establishement considers themself family friendly they need to expect this type of thing from small children.

I was in a car accident and I was told I had to utilize urgent care because the doctor was out of town: for more than a month with NO MEDICAL COVERAGE.

3. Switch to the electronic system, made her make major medication error and I had a mild stroke. Blood sugars in the 600-700s. She says it was not her mistake. Blames it on my insurance not approving my insulin. That was an outright LIE. Endocrinologist now prescribes the same amount I had been on for years. Eichler blamed me for not making enough appointments. I was seeing her every 8-12 weeks. She refused to speak about the stroke and said she knew nothing about it. 

4. I asked Eichler about solutions to lose weight (I was in OA), but she told me there was nothing else. She refused to discuss my weight struggles after that day. I believe it is because she hasn't dealt with her issue of being morbidly obese. My body is severely damaged as I now search for help to lose weight. 

5. I went to the pharmacy to pick up my regular medication and an antibiotic had been ordered for me. I called the office and  Mandi said Eichler had called the office (she was out of state) and said I had a urinary infection. The doctor or her assistant read the wrong labs.

The woman is a horrible physician and refuses to take responsibility when she makes a mistake or her staff makes a mistake. Mandi makes many decisions on her own.

Plus, the bartender was messy about it so the stem of my glass was STICKY, I ended up cleaning it myself. 

so $30 for an ounce of tequila and sticky sugar coated glass & a glass packed over the top with ice with an ounce of rum. Never again.

The answer is NO!. Everyone: the Host, server, bus-people, were wonderful, in fact very attentive. The first item was an onion appetizer. It was loaded with stiff, yet very greasy, breading. Nothing like the one at Outback, just way too much breading, grease, and LOADS of SALT. Both my guest and I had The Mushroom Swiss Cheese hamburger. I asked for sauteed onions (when I first ordered) and it came out with what looked like fine onion rings, breaded, and again greasy. This burger also had an unbelievable  amount of salt on it. It tasted as if each crater in the burger was filled with salt. I tried to pick it up to take a bite and it was falling apart from all the grease. The entire top of the bun looked like it was basted with oil. I had to eat it with a knife and fork.  The onion soup was decent, not the best that I have ever eaten and I would not go back for it as I would in other restaurants. The ice tea, unsweetened, was fine. Everyone was polite and in addition, the ladies were all sweet. At this point my stomach is still upset and that has been four above hours. I will never go back, and when I think of this place I will always think of GREASE and Salt, in that order, but very close. Could this have something to do with Friday the 13th, ha,ha!

But, then there was the service. My wife and I arrived. We ordered a round of drinks and an appetizer. Then, about five minutes later, my brother and sister-in-law arrived. We then waited another ten minutes and our appetizer came out. Still no drinks, not even water. My brother and sister-in-law then ordered theirs. Some minutes later, all four drinks came out together, 20 minutes into sitting there. We then ordered. 10 minutes later, we were asked if we wanted another round of drinks, and three of four of us obliged. 5 minutes later, our waitress came back, said there was a bit of a computer error and asked us to repeat our drink order. 5 minutes after that, a different waitress came to our table and said ""she is a little busy, I will take your drink order"", to which I replied, ""again?"". Finally, our food came. Everything was great, except what my sister-in-law got, compared to what she ordered, were not the same. At this point, she was not willing to wait another 20 minutes so she ate what she had. Side note- she was very happy with the quality of her meal but I think she would have preferred to have what she asked for. Needless to say, everyone at the table was frustrated. My sister-in-law works in the hospitality industry and I got the ""ok"" to say something to the manager. She approached and said ""how is everything?"" I then began to started to explain our story to her. She was very polite and apologetic and told us she would purchase our first round of drinks. I felt she handled this very well and I was appreciative. 

This is where I get very frustrated. 

If the manager tells me ""I am going to pick up your first round of drinks"", I expect her to pick up our first round of drinks. She comped a ten dollar ""gift card"" then a five dollar ""gift card"". This would be really nice except that a round of drinks for us was at least 23. Dont get me wrong, I do not care about the 8 dollars. I care about someone saying they are going to do one thing, then doing another. My wife and I live literally 3 minutes from there and it is by far the closest sports bar. This is my second ""not that great"" experience.

The decor is wonderful to look at.  The art on the walls, the hand blown chandeliers and unique lighting were delightful.  

We got there at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon before a concert.  There were 3 tables occupied and about 6 people sitting at the bar.  We had a party of 4.  We were told there would be an hour wait and I asked if we could wait at the bar and were told, sure, no problem.  The problem was that there were only 6 chairs at the bar.  There were 4 tables right across from the bar, but they had no chairs.  It was really odd as they were regular table height.  Later on, while we were eating there were people being served at these tables and standing while eating at these low tables.  It was soo odd.  

We waited about 30 minutes and got our table.  I had ordered the guacamole at the bar and when we got our table I had to wait to get the bartender's attention to help to transfer our drinks and stuff to the table.  It was the weirdest thing I had ever experienced.  Never had I been at a bar until my table was ready and no one even offer to move our stuff.  Should have known then.  When we were seated we were told that they needed the table avail for a reservation at 6.  No problem.  We waited over 20 minutes for ANYONE to come to our table.  No one would even make eye contact.  We got no water, no nothing.   Finally someone who was working on the other side of the room came over and filled our water glasses and then had a short debate with another waitress over whose table it was.  New waitress won.  We ordered some margaritas and a table full of appetizers and some soups.  We wanted to keep it light.  When my margarita arrived it was undrinkable.  It was SOOO tart that I could not take it.  I asked if it could be remade and was told no that they use the same mix that was made that morning.  I then got a Jameson and Ginger.

WiMwhNcT0Q2MogehW3zTDw,TRk6x2EgBhMv4RH_5_z6vw,qgHFlp4kP5zCWHOsMIsbOQ,1.0,0,0,0,"I had a terrible experience here back around 2005 while attending Vol State. It was my first apartment. Upon signing the lease, the woman in the office seemed nice. I wasn't able to move in for another two weeks, but she had me sign the lease right then and there, knowing I wouldn't be able to move in right away, in order to charge me a pro-rated rate and get herself a few more bucks commission. The least expensive 1 bedroom unit they had was on the 3rd floor - no elevator. An office manager lived on the 1st floor below me, and so began my nightmare. Even though I only had my dog with me for the first two months, (he was elderly and couldn't make it up the stairs), for a the rest of the year after moving in I would randomly get a $35 fine for dog poop found on the property. The office manager who lived two floors down from me claimed it was my dog, although she had no proof. She simply wanted someone to blame and bill. I told them that my dog hadn't been there for months, but they did not care. As another reviewer mentioned, other tenants have their dogs off leash walking all over the complex so it could have been anyone's. Meanwhile her two creepy identical dogs barked constantly. 

I heard from a neighbor that every time he went into the office, they would ask him if I had other people living in my apartment with me! Other than having the occasional friend from school or work over, I am a private person & enjoyed living alone. Then came the time they violated my tenant's rights. Convinced that I had other people living with me, but never having the respect to ask me directly, the same commission-hungry office worker calls me with a bogus excuse to enter my apartment. She claims she has to ""check the water heater"". I tell her that if she tells me what to look for, I can check it for her and tell her what is says. This does not suffice, and next thing I know she is knocking on my door with a clipboard (that had nothing on it). She goes and glances at the water heater, and it is apparent that she wasn't really checking for anything. All this was an illegal farce simply to try to see if I had more people living with me. Again, they could have just asked me like a human being. 

As a tenant I minded my own business, paid my rent on time, and made no complaints to the office. Finally at the end of the lease I moved out. My family and friends joined me to pack and deep clean the apartment, we even shampooed the carpets, which were not new when we moved in. Turns out they charged me thousands of dollars for things like ""dust on the ceiling fan"" and the ""smell of cat urine"" on the carpets, even though I never had a cat because I AM ALLERGIC TO CATS. 

It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I believe that I was mistreated and my rights violated because I was young and naive. Meanwhile, in buildings away from the office manager, there was a loud domestic violence situation and a possible drug dealer that never got any attention from the office. Please know your rights as a tenant, and stay far away from this greedy, awful, violating place.",2018-05-27 14:47:04

-MgOxfZn94UXEhsuSZ7Piw,i_bP4KSixcuHe6gix4oOQw,z2K-jFZhP7Em0Ol6p8V6kw,2.0,0,0,0,"The facts: 

They have ants. They clearly know they have ants, since there are signs everywhere forbidding any food or drinks in the bedrooms so as not to attract bugs. Peculiarly, however, there are zero ant traps anywhere in the house, so they do nothing to get rid of them.
The fact that there are lines of ants in certain places around the living room is one thing. However, the fact that at several points during the night I found an ant crawling on my *body* while I was lying in a *top bunk* on the *2nd floor* of the house, is quite ANOTHER. 
(No one had any food or drinks in our room.)

The touted free breakfast is very plain pancakes that every guest has to cook on their own from a bowl of batter, & you get to stand around in a long line waiting for your turn to even do it.

There are two rooms upstairs: a 4-bed & a 10-bed. They pretend the latter is 2 rooms of 4 & 6, but you must go through the 1st ""room"" to get to the 2nd one, & the door between them is missing, so - yeah, for all intents and purposes it's one single cramped 10-bed dorm. There is also one bathroom upstairs. 

Downstairs there's a 6-bed room, two 3-person rooms & one 2-person room. And one full bathroom & one tiny closet into which a small person can barely stuff themselves, containing a toilet & sink.

If you've lost count: that's 28 people & 2.5 bathrooms. Do the math yourself on just how well that ends up working out for guests...

The dorm rooms are tiny: about a third to a quarter the size of an average hotel room in SB. The cheap, unsteady metal bunk beds creak & shake like in an earthquake with every single movement anyone makes - on either the top or bottom bunk. I was woken up countless times during the night due to the girl on the lower bunk shifting around. Every time I climbed up or down the bed shook so much it nearly tipped over (I'm a petite girl). The round metal bars of the ladder hurt my feet just putting any weight on them.

(I've slept on bunk beds plenty in college, & they don't have to be this way at all. The bunks in my college dorms were sturdy wood; they didn't shift or shake or hurt your feet climbing on them. I've also been in plenty of European hostels, & in all of them the dorms are larger than IHSP, so that you don't end up within literal arms' reach of all your roommates.)

Some of my lovely experiences during the night while I was trying to sleep: my downstairs bunkmate not only shifted around nonstop, but took to obsessively counting & re-counting handfuls of coins in the late evening & very early morning; one of the guys in the perpendicular bunk snored; and the French guys opposite me would spend 10 minutes at a time rustling super-loudly through a bunch of plastic bags in their suitcases every time they came in or out - which was many times & also quite late at night & in the early morning.
While your own roommates may do different noisy things, there's little to no chance you'll get to room with only quiet & considerate folks; the point is I was treated to all this in surround sound due to the tiny room. Also every one of them kept startling me awake every time they'd go in & out of the room due to the loud door or because they'd keep turning the light on/off - that's 9 other people in that dorm room. Not to mention the uninvited roommates: the ants...

Overall I only got maybe 2-4 hours of poor-quality sleep, even with earplugs. As a result I was exhausted all next day, which ruined many of my plans. 


Prices:

The very cheapest here is a bed in a large dorm: that costs $45/weekday & $55/weekend night. Notably, this is a pre-tax/fee price: you need to add %15-16 to that for how much you'll really pay. This is approximately 1/3 of the price of a normal hotel room in SB; one that can comfortably fit 2 people & has a private bathroom. (This isn't even counting the possibility of getting a hotel room with 2 proper queen beds to fit 4 people, for the same price.)
So, at IHSP you'll pay ~$100-130 for 2 people, to sleep on creaky, shaky metal bunks, in a room one-third the size of a normal hotel room which will be shared with 4 (or 8) noisy, inconsiderate strangers, and have to use shared bathrooms in the hallway (2.5/28 ppl). If you spend just 1/3 more $, you can get a private hotel room for the same 2 people with normal accommodations. 

IHSP, by the way, also has one ""private"" double room with 1 large bed: this room is much smaller than a regular hotel room, has NO bathroom, is located right off the house's living room, & costs $160-$225/night pre-tax/fees. So they charge MORE than an average hotel for a double room of a much inferior quality. Do the math here - it just doesn't make any financial sense to stay with them.",2018-07-18 21:59:58

We went tonight and were immediately seated in the half empty restaurant. Our waitress was just terrible. She was honestly a checklist of how not to be a server.

1) She forgot drinks and had to be reminded three or four times to even bring water to the table. 

2) About three minutes after we had ordered, she She forgot drinks and had to be reminded. came over with a bill. We told her we had just ordered. Her response: ok but I'm just going to leave this here. Us: no, we didn't get our food yet. You took our order 3 minutes ago. Her: umm, are you sure??? I'm not sure if she was high or not. 

3) We then waited about 45 minutes for our salads to come. We asked multiple times and she was like ""oh yeah I'll get them right out to you."" We ended up asking the manager/owner who replied that she was making them. Making them? Btw, the salads were iceberg lettuce covered in a Catalina like dressing that was basically inedible.

4) After our salads came, she came over and told our table that they were out of gluten-free ravioli, which no one had ordered. She was confused at this and kept insisting they were out of it. We were now confused and asked if this meant our orders hadn't been put in even though we ordered over an hour ago. 

5) Our food came out around 7:40. We ordered around 6:15. It's pasta.

The food  is prepared substandard I actually got something in my bread bowl pasta that I couldn't detect what type of meat it was I only asked for beef so I wisely decided not to eat it. 
In addition to the mystery meat they didn't bother to sprinkle any powered sugar on my chocolate lava cakes, so I had hot crunchy cake without the star of the show.

I called and spoke with the ""manager"" who was condescending and over talked me never getting the actual details of the purpose of my call. 

He said I would ""receive 2 medium pizzas with my next order"". 
Well he lied  my next call was rerouted to  dead air or a hang up. 
Then I made the calls from Goggle and they answered to only put me on hold each time.

Obviously they found it amusing instead of honoring the offer.  

This was very childish and unprofessional 
And I bet he's delusional and calls himself a ""Man"".
A real man would've honored his word. 

The ""manager"" himself told me that I spent over $700.00 within 3 months. I also tip the drivers and donate to Saint Jude. I think that puts me in ""the valued customer"" bracket. 
I also reported this to Corporate they said that the owner would be notified of all details. It's been a week and no one called or left any messages.

I called the front desk prior to our arrival, as we are from out of state.  I specifically asked if the rooms were on the BEACH, and could our dually truck fit, as well as asking about the spa availability.  All questions were answered affirmatively.  To my surprise, I was informed upon check-in that the spa was only operating on very limited hours, and most services were not available at all, a fact that was conveniently left out of the information online.  We NEVER would have booked, had we known the spa was not available, as that was the main reason we chose a resort.  We were asked to park nearly a block away and walk back and forth to the resort.  Then we entered our room, which had a nice view of the bay, and a little view of the ocean, although it was FAR from beach front.  

A robe THEY FURNISHED had a makeup stain on it, and it was clearly still dirty from a previous guest.  The bed was terribly uncomfortable, and there was little more than a sheet and very light blanket for bed coverings.  

Most importantly, the pictures simply do not portray what the rooms actually are (they are much smaller in person).  We arrived late (interestingly, when I booked online, I said specifically we would be late, yet I still received a phone call asking for an exact time, which seems ridiculous, since we were on the road traveling and had no exact arrival time).

The representative who sold her the phone did not tell her about a restocking fee upon purchase and did not email her a receipt as promised (she had asked for a paper copy). The manager claimed he could do nothing about this. I hope that this is an isolated event, but would like to caution others who might be considering using 360 Wireless.

High ceilings with rooms overlooking the front desk and loung area of a awesome restaurant named Dragos. (check that review out. You won't be disappointed) Front desk staff was super friendly and helped me with a upgrade on my room too. Big thumbs up on that my guy. The room is nice and spacious. The only issue is it has TWO conjoined room doors. Guest on both side crazy loud. But hey it's NOLA and it's spring break. we go out and enjoy the food fair and sites that NOLA has to offer. (Swamp tour was beyond fun by the way.) upon our return from the swamp tour we get texts from our banking provider of clearly fraudulent charge attempts.. (by the way ppl always let your bank know when you're traveling. It'll save you major headaches in case of situations just like this) we get back to the room and to what do we see... OUR luggage, drawers and closets are all ran through. The safe didn't work so nothing was stored in it. The thieves stole a few valuables that could fit on their bodies because all the big cash cow items like our Mirrorless cameras and, drone and shoes and all were left alone. They stole off body wallets and AirPods. The thing is all that is easily replaceable. So that's not the big thing to sweat over. The thing that's bad is the management has done nothing and technically turned a blind eye to this. There's only two keys and we have both of them. We turned down room service at the front desk upon arrival. We want NO ONE to have access to our room especially during the covid times. Management hasn't come and spoken to us about any type of compensation to remedy this unfortunate situation or anything. They've been very dismissive of it. I shouldn't have to reach out to them after we filed a report of a situation on YOUR premises. Your job as a supposed prestigious hospitality is to always insure that you've delivered satisfactory service to your patrons. You should be reaching out to US to help ensure that this unfortunate situation can be rectified on your end. Very dissatisfied with the service and level of treatment. Hotel security is more helpful than its own hotel management. At this point. We know it's a inside job.

Like the others, I did not read these reviews before buying a Groupon.  My Groupon was for two Minty Mojito manicure-pedicures.  The business does not answer the phone.  The voice mailbox is nearly always full.  Eventually, I reached the merchant, scheduled an appointment and received my first service.  The service was adequate, although I was disappointed that there was no standard pedicure chair with a hygienic basin and massage feature but rather a plastic bucket placed into some kind of heating element.  I also thought that having to sit at a bar for my manicure was odd, as was the offer of an alcoholic beverage.  The shop was overly impressed with their bar concept and did not pay sufficient attention to the service or to professional behavior.  Throughout my service, the shop owner and the nail technician carried on a discussion about the technician's animal rescue business.  Because my Groupon entitled me to a second mani-pedi and I didn't want to try calling again, I scheduled my second service before leaving.  When I arrived for my second appointment, the shop was closed and the security gate was locked.  The shop appeared to have closed permanently, which did not surprise me as I'm sure this business will close in the near future.  However, since I was still owed a mani-pedi, I made about ten more phone calls until someone eventually answered the phone.  There was no apology for the missed appointment, but I was able to schedule a replacement appointment.  When I arrived at the shop for the replacement appointment, the security gate was raised, but the door was locked.  Another customer arrived about 10 minutes after I did.  Despite the cold, we both knocked repeatedly at the door and waited for about 20 minutes before the other customer left.  I waited for another 10 minutes before leaving again.

At some point during my move, my $500 TV stand was completely damaged beyond repair. The movers did not notify me when this happened. They only let me know when I asked about where it was at the end of my move, once they had already received their tip. I have no idea how this TV stand got destroyed like it did. When they took it from the first location, it was in one piece, securely put together. When it arrived at my new location it was in multiple pieces, completely destroyed. 

The mover said he would let Scott know about it and Scott would give me a call within two business days. Three days later I had to call and they had no idea what I was talking about. Scott finally returned my call five days later and all he could do was give me a $70 refund for my $500 TV stand. I have emailed the owner multiple times (I was not given a phone number, just an email address that Scott said the owner checks daily) with no response. 

Obviously I wasn't thinking I would get the entire amount of my TV stand back but $70 is literally nothing. I cannot buy a new stand for that. It must have fallen off the truck or something because this TV stand was sturdy and about 130 lbs. It doesn't just fall over or collapse. 

I am highly dissatisfied with the move as well. The movers had zero concern for my things, running into the walls and doors. I have multiple damages to my front door from them slamming into it.

The décor is pretty eclectic in a history museum/biker bar/ 1970s Americana type way. There is also a really bizarre seating arrangement and kind of a lot of wasted space. It was also really awkward to try to get a drink. If we sat, no one came to take our order. When I stood at the counter, I was generally ignored. No love either way. 

As for the cocktails....

It was really impressive to see the work and detail that went into making every single drink. It was honestly fun to watch! The dude with the black beard and baseball cap was definitely entertaining. But, when it came to my drinks (Honey Bee, and one other one I can't recall), it was just like ...""meh"". It was almost as if each of the ingredients that went into a drink was a really sweet colored Crayola crayon, but then all combined it turns into a boring, brownish mess.

I don't mean to be pretentious (even though this will DEFINITELY sound pretentious) but I've seen this type of cocktail bar well-executed in other cities, so I might just be spoiled.

Unbelievably rude receptionists.

Completely unprofessional, even if you have a lot on your plate which I'm sure they do, you should be doing your job better than this. They act as the barrier between me and my doctor(s) because as soon as I message a doctor on the portal with my concern, I am usually able to see someone, but over the phone with them I'm told ""A doctor can call you tomorrow or you can go to the ER.""

I was once ""fit in"" at the last minute for an ""appointment"" with a doctor when I called about having some sudden unknown pain. Stuck in traffic I was 10 minutes late for this ""last minute appointment."" The receptionists let me sit in the waiting area for 45 minutes when I got there.

The hotel itself is fine (I stayed here for almost a week). Front desk staff were friendly and did their job. The actual room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable, although the sheets seemed a bit cheap and rough. I'd avoid room service - like the front desk staff, the room service people were friendly and did their job, it's just they are delivering some of the most depressing, institutional grade food ever. The croissants will break your heart.
Also, I'd avoid the restaurants on premise. The Ruth Chris there is nothing special. There are two other ones that are churning out the same chain restaurant style food (including Mannings with their depressing 'easy chair seating in front of a large TV screen area').

The do a ton of conferences here. The conference staff ranged from on-the-ball to, well, whatever the opposite of on-the-ball would be. If they try to book part of your conference in any room in the casino area, protest. You don't want to be there. First, anything in the casino smells. Second, there is the constant electronic din from the machines outside that will slowly drive you crazy.
Otherwise, their conference space in the actual hotel is fairly handsome and clean.


To summarize: Why in the world are you coming here? This is New Orleans with lots of interesting hotel options. Why would you eat here? I mean, why come to New Orleans if you are going to eat at  Ruth Chris or the other on-premise restaurants? If you came here for the casino, well, roll your little bandit in there and have some fun with the saddest members of the 'Greatest Generation'.",2012-03-11 15:02:25

That's where my excitement ended, though. The veggie rolls appetizer was good, but not great, and at $8 for two, it didn't even match up to the $6 bag of vegetable egg rolls I have in my freezer. For my entree, I had the vegan yellow curry, and I was disappointed. The tofu portions were small, and though the curry tasted okay, it wasn't great. The worst part was the vegetables, which were undercooked, including the potato, which was crunchy and not at all tender. Blech! My husband had a similar experience with the vegetables in his peppered garlic tofu. I much prefer the yellow curry at Magasin, which also is a few dollars cheaper.

I need a new washer - bearings are shot and the refrigerator is hobbling along with a failing and noisy compressor.

I was disappointed in this place.   The showroom is great looking and has plenty of options.   You can also see things on line that you can't see in the showroom.   

Salespeople are friendly but don't get it.  I'm here to buy 3 appliances.   Work with me.   $40 bucks was all I was going to get.

Prices are high and not competitive with other offerings in the county.   In addition, there is a $79.99 delivery charge since the warehouse is in NJ, regardless of how many appliances you buy.  So add $80 to the sticker price.   For the washer, add new hoses.   They will not guarantee the install without out it.  Do not remember how much they wanted for that.   If I wanted the matching gas dryer, add $40 or so for the ""install kit"" and another $20 for a ""liability"" charge.  (Sounds like I am  paying  for install insurance?  My guess is that the installers are not Sears folk and that's why I am paying so I can argue with the installers and not Sears if and when things go south.)

I am thrilled to find a great restaurant or service provider. I love nothing better than to have an amazing experience and I would (and have!) happily paid hundreds of dollars for the privilege. It's when I pay hundreds of dollars (or even a few dollars) to have a terrible experience that I get upset.

Speaking of...

Virago is like a very pretty girl (or guy) who is all looks and no substance. Once you get inside you want a little something more, if you know what I mean. 

And so it was with this expensive waste of calories. 

Visually it was fantastic. Little Buddhas and Asian statues? Loved it. Lighting? Wall art. Staff uniforms. Fabulous. Food? Awful. Service? Sucked.

Like truly awful. Like amazingly awful. Like the kind of awful you have to tell people about. 

So here goes...

Yes, I recently moved here from Los Angeles - home of amazing sushi. I take that into account and I still come up with the verdict: awful. 

I'm not scared. I've eaten sushi from Publix here in Nashville and you know what? It was better. And so was the price tag. 

We paid almost $75 for 3 rolls and a glass of wine and one after the other they were all worse than the last. Even the wine--my faithful friend--tasted like dishwater. Strange. 

The fish was mushy and off-color, we're not in danger of food poisoning, but we were definitely shocked at the quality. And why does almost every roll include something tempura (fried) and cream cheese or mayo? I feel like the good people of Nashville are more than ready to break away from their eating stereotypes, is it strange that the Virago chef doesn't agree? 

And the service. Oh my. Nice enough server, but honey, learn to multi-task. A glass of wine should not take 20 minutes to arrive. Soy sauce in a sushi restaurant should be on the table, not have to be requested from 2 (TWO!) different servers and still take 10 minutes to make it to the table. And the check? When two people are sitting there with coats on holding their purses and craning around to find you...probably not a good idea to walk by and then attempt to walk by again without acknowledging your impatient diners. Just a tip that must not have come with the training.

All I ask from sushi are at least two out of these three things:

1. Be fresh.
2. Taste good.
3. Don't make me sick. 

Virago delivered on one. 

And, yes, I realize this is landlocked Nashville. Does that mean that good sushi can only ever be a fantasy? Ever been to Japonais in Chicago? Incredible! Food AND decor. Both amazing - and last I checked Chicago is not on the Ocean. Step it up Nashville. America's newest ""It"" city deserves a great sushi restaurant.",2013-03-14 20:00:14

We sat there for over two hours before our entrees arrived. Two hours. Keep in mind that wedding/banquet orders go in weeks in advance and wedding receptions are designed to begin at a contracted time, so I have no idea what the holdup was. And when the food arrived, it was subpar. It looked flabby and unappetizing and wasn't even hot. You would think if the food was two hours late it would at least taste fresh and hot out of the oven (because of all the time they had to make it!) but this food was lukewarm and very unappealing. I had the chicken parm, which I thought would be a sure bet since Georgine's seemed like a chicken parm kind of place (which is also why I did NOT get the prime rib, since I had my doubts about getting good prime rib at a banquet hall -- and I was right), but the chicken parm was a total fail; it tasted old and dry, had a generic tomato sauce on it, and was served with these funky looking wet roasted (or boiled but oddly brown?) potatoes. Who serves potatoes with chicken parm???? Weird. I tastes my friend's prime rib, which she had ordered medium rare but was clearly well done, and it was gray and bland. No horseradish, but it did come with wet roasted potatoes, if that's your thing. 

Food aside, the soda table always needed refilling - a drag since we had so much time on our hands - and the staff were nice, but young and obviously not very experienced servers. I don't mind inexperienced servers since everybody has to start somewhere, but it probably helped contribute to how late our food was, which was very frustrating.  And the biggest bummer was that the food took soooooo long that guests started leaving as soon as they finished eating -- before they even put out the desserts or cut the wedding cake! And I can't blame them because we had been there for 3 hours by then, but still, it was unfortunate. I never did get clear on why service was so far behind, but clearly something went wrong in the kitchen and for a place like Georgine's which handles events often, I consider that unacceptable. The whole thing was poorly executed and poorly managed.",2016-07-10 05:36:11

We walked in (a party of 2) and were greeted immediately by the hostess who then apologetically asked us to wait while she finished organizing some things, only to be sat down minutes later at the only available table which we were conveniently standing right next to. Why we had to stand there and wait for her to get organized when we were clearly going to be sat at that table as the only two guests waiting? Not sure. I used to work in a restaurant, I know how this works, and this shouldn't have been an issue. If it was going to be a few minutes she should have directed us to the bar to wait so we could at least be sipping on a beverage enjoying each other's company instead of being gawked at by the tables (come on guys you know how awkward that can be).  

We sit down and it takes about 8-10 minutes to be greeted by a server. The server quickly turned our disappointed selves into happy customers as she was quick to get our coffees, mimosa and appetizer out. We had the avocado toast, which was delicious! Then we were completely ignored by our waitress for a good 20-30 minutes. Why? I can only assume she knew where the larger tips lied, with the other 3 tables she had of large parties. It was amazing actually, how many times she visited those three tables catering to their every need while we were waiting for mimosa refills (another $14 added to the bill mind you = larger tip) and our meals. Brunch is finally served with a mimosa refill, phew! I ordered my eggs over medium and a Belgian waffle a la carte. My eggs were over cooked, the yolk was less than slightly running, and the waffle was cold to the point the butter was not cooperating in melting.

The tech came on time and was professional but was not able to correctly diagnose the problem. He said the air coming from the ducts was 56 degrees or something, so our place should cool. He adjusted the fan speed from medium to high and told us to keep the doors open to our bedrooms to help keep the rooms cool. He said our place should be cooled down to the programed temp of 68 degrees by the next day. We were charged about $250.00

Two days later we had the same problem.  Our place still wasn't cooling lower than 74 degrees, and it felt muggy.  We called them back and they said they would send out someone else to see what the problem was. We scheduled a new appointment.

A TSA agent there told me that the security checkpoint for terminals C-F had no line and I could get to terminal B from there no problem. So I backtracked back past the kiosk where I checked my bag, up another escalator toward the security checkpoint with no line. Apparently word must have spread, because there was now a line. No biggie, I expected a line anyway. What made it interesting was the woman in a rush who cut in line in front me at the bag screen conveyor belt. She was running late for her flight. Ok no problem. What was a problem was why they had to keep taking shit out of her bag and running it through the x-ray machine over and over. Then they found a problem in my laptop bag. I guess science fiction paperback novels give a false positive, because they had to run my book through by itself in a tray. 

Had to use the restroom in the terminal, with empty soap dispensers, empty paper towel dispensers, and faucets that don't work. Thankfully the toilets still flush.

When I arrived back in PHL after a week in Columbus, I came across a shady character in the baggage claim area with jacked up teeth that smelled like hell who asked me for 16 bucks for cab fare. She was carrying around a duffel bag, trying to look like she just arrived on a flight. This is why I run to baggage claim soon as I land in Philly, to get my bag before a crackhead does.

FcGn_S1CKxvXaPIbQb7DOQ,ZO_3j6bdpgDTnmVKkO3B2g,grEJZ7iyhUbF8xuwmFRdAA,2.0,10,1,0,"My husband and I were searching for something ""affordable"" on 4th of July weekend since we had a wedding in Montecito to go to. With that said, staying in SB made sense. After some combing and you-gotta-be-kidding-me's regarding the holiday weekend prices, we ended up booking a ""cottage"" at the Villa Rosa Inn.

Firstly, let's start with the fact that these are NOT cottages. It's a rundown apartment next to the actual Inn. Luckily, the staff was really friendly and helpful when we arrived late Wednesday evening to check in. As a sidenote, our friend who also attended the wedding informed us that when he drove up the day before the wedding a bit earlier than check-in time (he had already booked), they told him and his wife to ""go away."" So, it would seem that service is spotty. Needless to say, they didn't stay. They drove back to LA and drove up for the wedding the next day. I don't blame them.

Ok, back to the ""cottage""...We were staying in ""cottage"" (yes, I'm going to keep using quotation marks) #3. Though it was spacious (living room area, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom), there was much to be desired. The decor was...well, it looked like they had picked through a dumpster from the World Market. Strange stampeding elephant paintings, odd red leather seats, a less than clean grayish-red couch...to be fair, sitting and musing about the decor was a point of entertainment, but it didn't make up for the feeling we both had that we had just wasted a lot of money. 

The kitchen was nice, but the glasses, dishes, and pots & pans looks like things found at a garage sale. I mean, c'mon, just go to Ikea and buy a cheap set of matching dishes and glasses. I was too suspicious of them to use them...though my husband used one of the odd blue-glass goblets to sip his beers. It was very Macy's circa 1992.

Also, the kitchen had no paper towels...or towels for that matter. Not a paper product in sight. I'm not about to go buy tons of napkins, towels, dishwashing soap, sponges, and so forth to stay for 4 nights...sorry. No dice.

The bathroom was tiny and dank. Weird orangey, stone tiles were likely installed so as to not have to clean as thoroughly as a white tiled situation would have required. No real space to put anything aside from a tiny shelf. The shower head was too low and my poor husband had to bend his knees to wash his hair. Mind you, he's 5'10"", so it's not like he's a basketball player. Additionally, it seems all of these apartments share a water heater because we had at least one morning where we couldn't get any hot water. The last thing I need is a cold shower in an already dark, dank apartment...er ""cottage"".

And the bedroom...the bed was rock solid. We got one pillow each, not counting the strange pillows used for embellishment. We wouldn't touch those with a 10 foot pole. They were musty and clearly not cleaned. Same with the bedspread. We pulled that off the minute we got in. Same kind of overly patterned mamma-jamma to likely avoid deep cleaning. This left us with a sheet and one of those weird, caramel-colors fuzzy blankets that you find in cheap motels you pay by the hour. We only kept it because I needed SOME warmth, though I tried not to make contact with it.

The place had no AC, so we had to keep the patio door (in the bedroom) open most of the time we were there. At night, we closed it and ran the two cheap fans (not ceiling fans - the kind of fans you get on sale at Staples) all night. It gave me a neck cramp and dried out my sinuses, but was the only thing that kept the place from becoming a hot, dank, hellhole.

A note about the patio. I appreciate that there was one, but it looked like a ruin. It hadn't been swept in NEVER and the patio furniture was so dusty and gross, there was no way we were going to be sitting on any of it. Another disappointment to add to the rest of the disappointments.

We also really enjoyed (this is sarcastic if you haven't guessed) the maid cart that was parked outside of our door most days full of cheap soaps (we didn't use the soaps. Read in a previous review that they don't lather) and the bucket of dirty water with the mop. Charming. The walkway to the ""cottage"" had a lovely toilet with a plastic tarp half slung on it too. Very rustic. Peeling paint, mismatched outdoor furniture, odd decor...but Anthropolgie this was not.

It just made us feel kinda dirty most of the time, which is why we spent most of our vacation NOT there. This place's ONLY saving grace and likely the reason it hasn't done anything about it's shoddy appearance or dated everything is it's location. A few steps from the beach and right near State Street, you can get to all the places you need to go in SB from there.

But, there is no way we'll ever be going back. If anything, this hole really made us appreciate just how wonderful our own apartment is. Someone call Hotel Impossible on this place. It needs help desperately.",2013-07-08 03:45:13

Drinks arrived shortly thereafter.  Throughout the course of our meal, our often absent server continuously refilled my Sprit but never once offered the others another cocktail.  Call me crazy but empty cocktails on the table equals instant upsell.

As for food, it was collectively a big letdown.  I had the ahi tuna nachos.  It consisted of maybe 4 ounces of ahi tuna on top of lettuce and tostado chips which tasted of cardboard.  I ended up eating just the tuna because the chips were so inedible.  One of my friends had the pork rind nachos.  That was a big misnomer.  It was in fact a huge tray of pork rinds and a bowl of queso - more like (pork rind) chips and quest rather than nachos.  My other friend had the burger and gave it an A-OK review.

 Killamanjaro is located in a strip mall with free parking,  however the lot was full and I had to park around the corner.  Even though I parked down the street and around the corner, immediately upon leaving my car I could smell the unmistakable spices of African food! On my way to the restaurant, I went into what the army calls a quick step.
 The aroma was intensified inside and I sat down in a quaint little dining room with high hopes. The server was a very nice young lady who brought me the menu. After looking over the menu it became clear to me that this was food from the country of Senegal, which is puzzling to me because Kilimanjaro is in East Africa.
 I had already tried many of the items before at other spots,  and one dish called Yassa Philly caught my eye. First I want to tell you that I never order anything that seems out of place and not authentic on a menu. To me its like ordering a Philly cheesesteak in Cheyenne Wyoming- You are rolling the dice!
 However I did not listen to that voice, and I sure wish I would've! 
 I ordered the Yassa Philly with beef, the presentation of the dish was beautiful. The plating of the meal was excellent, the rice, the vegetables and the Beef smothered in a spicy savory Yassa sauce. The rice was unmistakably African and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. But when I try to taste the beef, I couldn't cut it even with a steak knife. The cut of beef was so tough, with so much tended and gristle, my American teeth were no match for it.
 Just about then the server walked over to my table and asked how the food was. I told her that the beef is very very tough, she just nodded and walked away.  I really wanted to like this place, but how can you ignore a complaint like that and walk away?

The wait was all that we were warned it would be. Don't be fooled- the queue is like Disneyland, you can only see about a third of the line when driving or walking by. We didn't time it exactly but it was probably 30 min. wait to place our order and pay before being seated then another 15 mins to be served. There are menus available to read in the line if you are not familiar with their bill of fare. I am not sure why they don't have two cashiers/order takers? Seems like it would make things move along much more effectively. Other places that we have been to that have long waits offer coffee or water to people in line- no such courtesy here.

As others have stated, nearly everything on the menu is about 40 percent overpriced- we ordered very lightly and the tab was about twice what I have ever paid for an equivalent breakfast even in the most trendy places.

It was too cold outside to sit on the patio - so as you might expect, there was little indoor seating to be had. We ended up having to clear a table and wipe it off ourselves to have a place to sit. There was no comment or acknowledgment from the staff about our situation. 

Unbeknownst to us, we were at a spot right by the exit so each time a party of ~10 took their sweet time to get through the doorway, we were treated to a blast of 40-degree weather for an uncomfortable amount of time.

It's nice that they have ""water stations"" with both sparkling and still water on tap. It would be appreciated if the sparkling water was better labeled; maybe with a contrasting color?

When our meals finally arrived at our table, they were less than piping hot and the situation was not helped by the above-mentioned frigid blasts. The portion sizes were on the petite side to be gracious- especially given the prices.

No silverware or napkins were brought with our meals so we had to ask for them- the server gave us a blank look like we were asking for something exotic. Finally, we got eating utensils so we could begin our meal.

No one ever came by to offer coffee refills, I guess that's not their thing. The coffee flavor was about a 4 out of 10. I would have ordered a different drink if I had known the coffee would be so bland.

I ordered a side biscuit since I figured if ""biscuit"" is in their name, the biscuits must be spectacular. Wrong. BL's biscuits are more like corn muffins in texture and flavor. The berry jam that came with the biscuit was tasty and the only thing that we were served that I would call a ""generous"" portion. Far more jam than biscuit to put it on.

The bottom line for me is ""would you go again?"" Would I willingly endure nearly an hour wait for an overpriced and largely cold small portion breakfast? Definite Pass!",2019-11-12 03:49:00

After we filed a complaint with consumer complaint he went into action. On April 17th  he called and agreed to take a look at why check engine light was on for 3 months. He told me to take it to Grand Prix Auto.  I took the vehicle on April 18th at 3:00 pm. I left my vehicle and my witness came to pick me up. I kept in contact with Michael the owner of Grand Prix he assured me he was going to fix the check engine and check on the issue. 

I communicated with Mike daily, when it was time to pick up my car Mike also said I have a massive leak in the front of the engine. On the April 23rd I picked up my vehicle with an attachment of a nightmare, because Mike tried to charge me $55.00 for maintenance. When I refused, he said was not releasing my vehicle. My witness and I had to call the police to get my vehicle back, as well as call Mitch. When I contacted Mitch, he communicated with Mike to release the car and he will pay for everything. He also stated he will investigate and take care of why the check engine like is staying on. 

After this ordeal it has been very difficult to get in contact with Mitch. He has been giving me the run around. And nothing has been resolved. I contacted him today and he stated he would fix the problem. I believe it is too late. As of May 5th I had to tow my car to his dealership, because I was informed that my car died. I have a warranty that is not helpful and a dealership who sold me a vehicle that stop working after 3 1/2 to 4 month. And I know is a law against that, I am not sure where to start.

Last night, my sorority sister and I attended the musical ""ONCE"" at the Academy of Music.  We arrived at the avenue of the arts w/ about 15 minutes to spare until curtain time and figured this would be a decent lot to park in.  WRONG... The lot was FULL - but instead of posting a ""FULL LOT"" sign, they kept sending cars up to the next level.  By the time we reached the rooftop level, which obviously had NO PARKING, we were redirected back down to the third floor - where there was a traffic jam of cars, with the parking attendance insisting that we 1) pull our cars to the side; 2) take his ticket and 3) leave our keys in the car.  At that point we had already wasted a good 10 minutes, so we didn't really have the option that I would have chosen - 4) ""LEAVE AND FIND A NEW GARAGE.""  Unfortunately the spots where the attendant told us to pull up meant we were blocking in other cars that were trying to leave and as such, resulted in a ""parking wars"" scenario.

Ok, so throughout the show all I could think about was my car and whether or not it would be there as I left it when we returned.  After my stolen car experience, I guess you can say I have slight parking garage paranoia.  

After the show - we returned to hundreds of people in the lobby of the garage waiting for their cars... Unfortunately there were several different lines and everything was super confusing.  Some people were able to pay and go get their cars while others had to wait for their cars to be brought down.  Unfortunately there was no signage or no sense of direction from the workers - so it was a complete cluster*uck.  We waited in a total of 3 lines - #1 to validate and pay for our ticket, #2 to wait for our car to be brought down to the first floor only be to directed to line #3 on the 3rd floor.  An hour and 15 minutes after the show ended, we were finally on our way out of the garage.

First, I paid extra money from the dress company for extra length since I am 5'10"" and wanted to be sure the dress wouldn't be short. The first thing they did was pin the length of the dress. I had on the flats I will wear with the dress and said I wanted the dress to touch the floor. After that, they adjusted the straps. I have hips that bumped me up a size in the dress so the waist and bust are quite loose. By pinning up the straps to a reasonable fit, it raised the length of the dress. Unfortunately, it wasn't something I thought of until after the fact...I've not had a full length dress altered before, but I feel this is something they (the experts) should have considered. They did not. In trying the dress on after picking it up (and paying over $100), I found that not only does the dress not touch the floor but it is uneven all the way around. On the left of the picture (if I am able to attach it), it nearly touches the ground. On the right of the picture, it clearly doesn't. I find this unacceptable, but the fabric has already been cut. There is no going back now. 

Also, the hook and eye closure (to secure the straps behind the neck) on the dress came with the hook but no eye. It was secured by a flimsy piece of white thread. I brought this to the seamstress's attention saying it was missing the other half and wasn't secure. She said she would fix it. What I didn't know was that her way of fixing it wasn't to add an eye but to change out the thread to a single strand of purple thread. No point to that.

I've always been impressed on Saturday/Sunday mornings when they're packed. During those times, they're on their A-game. Today, it was slow. Not many people in the dining room. I had a craving for their chorizo breakfast chimichanga and Peppy was closed (as usual... another review for another time ).

Anyway, I ordered a side of fruit and bacon (chewy, not crunchy) and both were spot-on. As was the coffee. But when the chimi arrived, I gasped. It was obviously microwaved, NOT deep fried. The queso was more ""1000 Islandy"" in color. It was pink/orange and had the consistency of cheez-wiz.

Usually, their queso is white, thick, creamy and coats the chimi on all sides because when it's applied in proper melted form, it's poured on and flows down the sides. Not so today. It looked as if room temperature, pre-manufactured cheese sause (or dip) was scraped out of a jar and plopped onto a spread of bland chips and atop the chimi. Since both items were microwaved, they were scalding hot INSIDE, but their surface temp was not sufficient enough to melt these solid plops of ""Feuqso.""  Truly disappointing but I didn't say anything and still tipped well.

My server seemed forgetful and lost a lot in translation. I think everyone working there was just ready to close and go home. Understandable. I dare not return again  on a weekday afternoon and highly suggest yal avoid that day/time slot also.

When you are doing your personal risk assessment as to ""will I likely catch COVID19 from eating at this place?"", you might want to cross this Dickey's off your Dine-In list. 

We have went here twice since Dine-In was reopened in the state. The 1st time the employees we're wearing no masks and the condiment table and ice cream machine were a self service free for all. We ate there but did not feel comfortable. 

We tried to go there again today after the new, tighter mask wearing requirements went into effect. 

This place? Nope. Only 1 out of 4 employees was wearing a mask. The folks preparing your food were not wearing masks. Food service being what it is, there is no way that the employees can maintain 6' between each other as they go about their shift duties. 

We wrote a complaint to the owner and got back the most patronizing reply. He was not requiring his employees to use masks. 

I am not saying that anything here that is against code, but these folks are WAY behind Industry Best Practices for food service around town. And they do not give a sh1^t.

I took my parents here last night to celebrate father's day (a couple of days late.) We were all excited about the decor and the whole ""supper club"" feeling. And the aesthetic didn't really disappoint. 

The entire meal, however, was just a huge waste of money. (We spent over $500 and walked away wishing we had our money back.) None of the food was good, some of it was okay and a lot of it was just bad. Here are some notes: 

Oysters Rockefeller ($18): ZERO flavor, just texture from breadcrumbs. (Might have been frozen, tbh). 

House gorgonzola chips ($11): Kinda tasty, but let's be honest here, Chef - they're just house-made chips with gorgonzola dressing on top them. 

Jumbo prawns ($MP): These were actually good. But how could they not be? They take no preparation besides poaching and popping them in the fridge. 

The Chateaubriand 20oz Filet ($80!!!):  I shared this with my wife. It tasted okay, but we both noted that it smelled totally rotten. In fact, everyone at the table had a sniff and we all had the same reaction: ""what the heck is that!? It smells like death."" Later, after we got home, both my wife and I made b-lines to the bathroom. Idk what was up with that steak, but it got us. 

The Scalloped Potatoes ($11): Basic AF. If this came from a box, I wouldn't be surprised. 

Creme Brulee ($9) this tasted totally fine and delicious. 

Chocolate Cake ($12): Other people have noted this in their reviews, but what is up with this Chocolate Cake. It was completely hardened and cold? Maybe that's how it's supposed to be, because it's Ganache, but we all agreed that it wasn't good, at all. Idk who in the kitchen is eating that and thinking it's something worth serving. 

Overall, we just felt ripped off. I mean we're paying over $500 dollars (party of 5) to dine at this place, we at least want to eat delicious food, not be dripped on the AC unit (IT'S AN OLD BUILDING! is a lazy excuse), and be served by someone who is confident and helpful (the guy was nice, but seemed very much like an awkward rookie). 

And, Chef - what are you doing? Is this a job where you're just buying time until the next thing comes up? If so, remember that your lack of care is at customer's expense - and that really sucks.  

And Dan - Maybe this place is just better suited to be a cocktail bar that serves burgers and steak frites? Maybe you're going too big with the whole high-end steakhouse concept.",2019-06-21 16:47:05

The crab cakes were tasteful but on the small side. Only 3 shrimps on the entree. The zucchini pasta was tasteless and lumpy. They didn't drain the zucchini and it left a lot of soupy water on the bottom, which might explain the tasteless flavor. 

My veal copeland was good, but served on an undersized plate. I had to keep pushing it back to keep it from spilling over. 

The biggest issue for me, was the fruit flies. They were everywhere. On the lamp, the table, crawling on my girlfriend's coffee cup. The table lamps are dirty, always have been. You can see the sticky grease clinging to the shades and wall plate with hair stuck to that.

So we sit down and our waiter asks us for our drink order, we order and brings over a thing of sauces but doesn't say what they are or why they are there.... 

We order egg rolls, dumplings, a Changs spicy chicken and double pan fried noodles. The dumplings were good, but the presentation was key, the dumplings were 4 to an order for 5 bux....high in my opinion. Egg rolls were two per order and were bland and very mediocre and again for 5 bucks....kinda steep. 

We finally inquire about the sauce after our apps and the waiter was like OMG totally forgot about that! And mixed stuff...i wasn't impressed and basically ignored the stuff there. 

Entrees. I was expecting great things but again was highly disappointed. The chicken tasted like McDonald's chicken nuggets with some duck sauce and some hot pepper mixed in. This is their ""addicting"" dish? It sucked! The pan fried noodles were good, i enjoyed them but they were odd.

Since I moved in it has beed only two weeks. 
Air conditioner is not that cool enough but luckily I dont usually sweat ot get hot. Water draining in the bath tub was fixed but toilet? I need to flsh at least three times ... wtf... 
Water from vanity or the sink .. is actually warm... never had a cold water. 
Air vent hood was extremly dirty( ridiculously apartment always deduct deposit for cleaning and whenever i move into new apartment effing dirty...)
And I realized the refrigerator is not working. My food were gone bad. I told to the office and the worker came in three days after... (seriously, its been only two weeks.. and which one is properly working? Dont they check before someone is moving in?) Storage in the patio, the key didnt work so worker stoped by to open it. He tried but couldnt open it. He told he is going to get a key and never came back. 
I can hear every steps, cough, even toilet flushing sound from other unit. I wish I never had signed a lease.

I had my exam booked for yesterday, and unfortunately I don't know my examiners name. He let me know he ""wont ask me to do anything illegal or trick me"", yet we did something illegal before even leaving the parking lot. Its hard to explain but I'll try: When you leave your parking space, you are supposed to reverse and slowly move the car until your able to turn the car (so you can start to drive), and leave. He freaked out, and yelled at me ""STOP!!!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" and made me drive across 2 parking spots to get out. Meaning if there were cars there, I would have hit them. I tried to ask him how the heck what he asked me to do was correct and he started giving me this lecture ""IM the instructor. I know what Im doing. You don't question what I tell you to do. I told you I wont make you do anything illegal"". Um okay. 

The rest of the test was similar to the above, him freaking out at me for everything. He failed me unjustly. I was in a 50km zone, the sign was RIGHT THERE. He freaked out saying im too fast, even though I was driving between 40km to 45km just to be safe. There are so many other things that were complete BS on this test. 

Also, he really thinks he's above everyone else. Any time I tried to say something he'd reply with ""IM THE INSTRUCTOR. I KNOW WHAT I'M TELLING YOU TO DO. I AM IN CHARGE OF THIS TEST"", and other crap. 

I am going to be figuring out how to complain about him to the registry on Monday. This was unbelievable and unacceptable behaviour. I was polite to him the entire time, yet I was getting yelled at and preached for everything. Also, I went to a very good driving school, so I do know how to drive correctly and park etc. 

It's very obvious that he was stressing me out on purpose, and caused me to fail just for the $$ since I have to re-do the exam now.

I know this sounds hard to believe. No, I'm not making up things up. I wish I would have failed because of my own driving, so I could have learned from it and it would have made me a better driver. I went in to the registry with the mindset ""Its okay if I fail, there's always next time!"" Instead, I was being yelled at and told to do illegal things. I have never had such a bad experience in my entire life. Absolutely ridiculous.",2015-08-16 20:36:47

My washer broke, my landlord called them to come out and look at it. The technician arrived and was at my apartment for about 5 mins and said that my outlet was bad and recommended that I run an extension cord from the washer to another outlet (I live in an old house, the other outlet he told me I should try is an original two prong outlet). I told him that would not work and that I didn't feel comfortable doing that. So, my landlord then called an electrician to come out and look at the outlet. The outlet was fine, when my landlord called the Appliance Doctor back to tell them this the technician lied and said that I ran an extension cord to another outlet and the washer worked.

They sent another technician out the following day, in a short amount of time he said the mother board was bad and he would order a part to fix it. The next week we still did not hear back from them, they told my landlord it would be in by Wednesday. Come Wednesday we do not hear from them, they called on Thursday and said they would be out on Friday. Friday morning I received a call saying they were overbooked and would be out on Saturday. I then received a call Saturday morning from the technician saying he would not be able to come; I have a stack-able washer/dryer and they scheduled the technician there by himself. Obviously one person cannot remove a dryer from on top of a washer! They finally came on Monday (today) and fixed my washer. This took over two weeks to complete.

I've made several purchases at the Franklin Mills location while tolerating what I already know to be mediocre service at best.  Today, however, I had such a poor experience that I will not return.  

I walk in and get the look-down by the emotionless broad at the door.  I look around and actually make eye contact with several employees, none of which ask me if I need help or to let me know someone will be with me shortly...in EVERY department of the store.   

The store is a mess, particularly the pro-audio section where there are more used than new items for sale.  Many of the used items are in poor condition yet the prices are as close to retail as they can possibly get...sorry, ""list"".  That area of the store is nearly un-shoppable.  There are no merchandising standards enforced.  

I asked the clearly bored girl at the door nearest pro-audio who would be the best person to have help me in that area and she pointed to the guy behind the counter who already made eye contact with me several times who said very abruptly, ""What do you need?""  He appeared to be too busy to help and I'm sure what he was doing had value.  But, if he wasn't willing to help me, he should have paged someone who would.  I explained what I was looking to do and asked for help in selecting a PA system.  He never left the back of the counter to come show me anything.  All he did was say that it would cost me anywhere from $3-$4k and directed me to the 2017 Holiday Gift Guide, which he referred to as the ""magazine"".  

Guess what, I was willing to spend the money in your store today to start my venture because I have always believed in your brand.  But, you can thank that guy for looking away and asking another customer if they needed to check out after referring me to the ""magazine"".  The magazine does not answer any of my questions about what I need, what does what, etc.    

Sam Ash may think that they are one of the only games in town but you have more than just Guitar Center to compete with.

You can either sit at the counter or in an expansive booth and the waitresses had no problem letting just the two of us take up a booth. The diner was fairly empty when we went around 5pm on a Sunday but our waitress seemed pretty harassed and was rushing around.

I knew I wanted a dessert no matter what so the first thing I ordered was a slice of apple cake. It was amazing! Perfect crumbly top that broke apart to reveal chunks of apples and an incredibly moist, delicious cake. 

I went on to order the baked meatloaf with the chicken orzo soup and a side of spaghetti. The side of spaghetti was really just for laughs, I'm shocked that's even a choice and I couldn't resist picking it over two vegetables options. 

The chicken orzo soup was quite good but very onion heavy. I like onions but it would be pretty overwhelming for anyone interested in a more moderate chicken soup dish. 

The meatloaf came with a mushroom gravy that had already congealed by the time it arrived at our table. The dish was lukewarm and outright cold in patches. 

The spaghetti side was pretty substantial, not enough to be a restaurant entree but definitely a portion you would serve yourself at home. There wasn't a lot of sauce to go with the noodles, I'm sure they would've given me more sauce if I'd requested it but I took most of it home with me. The sauce tasted like a generic canned sauce.

My friend ordered the Western Omelette and the presentation left a lot to be desired, even for a bare bones diner meal. It was sloppily put together and off center on the plate. My meal totaled to $15 with tip which is a little bit pricier than diners I've been to elsewhere but excuse it based on the location.",2016-09-27 17:47:33

Sadly my experience here was less than stellar, in fact it was downright disappointing.  I stayed here for my wedding, May 30 - June 2 (Wedding on June 1).  I also had several guests staying here, 10 rooms.  At $250 per night with a 2 night minimum, we were responsible for $5,000 for the hotel that weekend.

I brought welcome bags to be delivered to the 10 rooms.  They told me they could not hand them out to guests at check in, they had to be delivered to the rooms at $3 each.  Slightly annoying because I dropped bags off at 5 other hotels, and none charged me, and all handed them out at check in successfully.  But, whatever, every hotel has different policies, no problem.  The issue was, on the first day I had 3 of the rooms check in, from 2:00pm - 7:00pm, and no one got their bags that night.  I was later told it was because they got busy, and by the time they checked on the bags at 8:00pm, they felt it was too late to deliver them to the rooms, but that sounds like just one terrible excuse to me.  I continued to follow up about the bags throughout the days, and I believe the rest were delivered. However, this is the last thing I wanted to be worried about on my wedding weekend. Also, my aunt was one of the first to arrive and not receive her bag on that first day, and when she went down to the front desk the following morning to ask about it, she told them it had her breakfast in it, and the charming man at the front desk actually looked through the contents of the bag and basically told her it was not a big deal and made a sarcastic comment about the fact that it only had 2 boxes of cereal in it. When she was standing at the desk talking to this employee who was holding her bag, she asked for it and he said ""I'm sorry, I can't give this to you, we have to deliver it to your room"" with a very rude tone. Are you kidding me?!  You already failed miserably at that, just give her the bag. He did eventually give her the bag, but did I get charged for delivery of that bag anyway? Yes, of course I did.

I tried to check in a little bit early on Friday because I had my rehearsal at 4:00 and wanted to shower and get ready before.  I think check in time is 3 or 4, I tried to check in at 2:30, but my room was not ready.  I told them that I needed to shower and get ready and they said that they would call my cell phone as soon as the room was ready, so I gave them my cell phone number.  I was already pretty close on time, so I decided to shower in my aunt's room.  Good thing, because I never did receive that phone call to say that my room was ready.

I was not impressed with the room. The view was nice, but the room was boring and bland. I don't know that I would have even noticed this if I didn't already have such a bad vibe from the hotel.  In addition to all of this, we didn't even get so much as a ""congratulations"" card on the night of our wedding.   All in all the whole experience was just extremely disappointing.  I definitely expected more out of the Hyatt brand.  We splurged to stay here for our wedding night, and I really wish we would have stayed ANYWHERE else. All of the other places we delivered bags to were so friendly and helpful! We won't be back.",2013-07-10 05:19:55

I saw that this place had a ton of reviews that were positive and I wanted a coffee, so a friend and I decided to check this place out. There was a line that had about 10-15 people, which we both thought was odd, but then we noticed there was a sign that said ""All Day Access $25."" Something I gleaned from the other people in line was that they were having a private party, and the people who had All Day Access were the ones who could skip the line and go right inside. 

However, everyone else had to wait in line to get access. The line didn't look very long, so why not go ahead and wait, we thought? Well... we waited for over half an hour to get inside. Every time we considered leaving, someone else would be allowed in, so it was a case of feeling like as soon as you left, you'd be allowed inside. If you looked inside, you couldn't see very many people, I think they were keeping it to 3 or so. Maybe there was a private room somewhere else with people? A group of 3 in front of me tried to go in together, but they weren't allowed. Even when one said they were paying for their friend... The guy at the door said they couldn't, and they weren't allowed to bring the money in. They to meet them at the door, take the money, return with the change, and wait for their food. Also, they required a $5 minimum, not just on cards... for ANYTHING. So you were basically required to order food and a drink in order to even eat here.

Then when it was my turn, the bouncer (he acted like that, so that's what I'm calling him), wouldn't allow me and my friend to go in together either because there was still one or two people inside. And then he told us not to sit down, that we were required to take the food to go. It felt like they made people wait in line so they could charge that $25 for people, and encourage them to purchase the All Day Badge instead of just wanting to get a coffee to go. I felt like they didn't care at all about any of the customers, and they didn't explain why it was over half an hour's wait when there were a total of three people in the front room. I felt like a number, and not a customer to them. Like I said, it was a very bizarre way to treat people, and I feel like if they had explained some reasoning, it would have been a more pleasant experience.",2019-04-27 19:36:14

I ordered from Joey's with a friend probably a week ago and the delivery man came early and gave us our food, and it was good.

***

Tonight I ordered a gyro and a stromboli: I got a call a few minutes after I placed my order saying they ""ran out of bread to make gyros""... I was really disappointed but ordered a caesar salad in its place.  They told me it'd be about 45 minutes until I got my food.  About 40 minutes later I got a phone call from someone who could hardly speak english saying they had my order so I hung up and ran out front of my dorm and no one was there.  I waited for 5 minutes and even went to the back entrance, no one was in sight.  I called the delivery man back and through his terrible english I managed to figure out he was lost.  I told him my address again and he said ""okay hold on a second"" then hung up on me.  I waited for another ten minutes and never got a phone call back.  I called the restaurant and told them I believe their delivery man is lost: the man who answered the phone was very rude and told me ""yes, we know, he is coming back to the restaurant because he can't find it- and I will deliver it"" (also in very poor english).  At this I was pretty upset... not only did no one call me to let me know what was going on, but now my food was going to be even more late AND cold/soggy.... the man on the phone did not apologize and he did not offer to make it right in any way.  Fast forward to me waiting senselessly for another 15 minutes and calling the restaurant AGAIN (because no one felt it was necessary to tell the paying customer who was waiting in the rain what was going on), and a girl answered the phone and I was demanding to know how the company was going to make this right and she had no idea what was going on at all but offered to take my name and number and ""have someone call me back"".  More time elapses and I get a phone call from that same rude man I talked to earlier, and in broken english he tells me he can't figure out how to get to my address.  I told him in explicit detail how to get there (very simple directions) and then he cries out ""I have to get out of my car and walk?!"".  Mind you, within the hour of my life I wasted waiting for my food I saw at least four delivery men come up and leave food ordered from various people at my dorm.  I walk around the dorm and waited in the rain for the delivery man to finally make his way up the sidewalk.  My first question was calm and simple, ""how are you going to make this right?""... and he actually had the audacity to make it my problem and tell me I am the reason they couldn't find it- how dare I ask them to find such a location... and he continued to wave his hands and talk at me very disrespectfully; I was an inch from giving it back to him.  Finally he said ""fine! just take it for free"" as he shoved it at me, and then exclaimed it didn't matter anyhow because the business was shutting down for good tomorrow anyhow.

I have never been treated so badly by a restaurant in the United States in my life.  I was blown away with the amount of disrespect and lack of customer service.  If they are legitimately shutting down I can understand why!!",2016-10-02 00:28:15

Channeling Bette Davis... What. A. Dump. There aren't too many stores that don't offer items you couldn't find at Target. The lack of decent anchor stores has caused the quality of the other retailers to really drop off a cliff over the last decade. And since they shuttered the movie theater, there's no real reason to patronize for most people. 

Not a horrible place if you only want to hit the food court for lunch, and you can park in the upper garage in the back to get in and out of there quickly if you're only going for a bite. The people watching in that space can be fantastic as well, but be prepared to go with the flow.

The urban clothing stores don't fit my style, but if they do yours this might be a good place for you. There are many of them inside, and they always seem to be having sales. Can't vouch for the quality of the gear however.

USF should have bought it, condemned it, and built their football stadium there when they had the chance. But if it keeps going like this, they might be able to get a better deal on it in the near future.",2011-05-29 05:04:52
PequMWBsEjiNrzp-wewKYQ,9eNliXKTZTI3yFR4OO12cQ,oBhJuukGRqPVvYBfTkhuZA,2.0,0,0,0,"Went there twice this weekend, so I've got a review for the bar on Friday night and for Sunday brunch with a few out of town guests.  

Friday night at the bar: Weird vibe, but reasonable drink prices.

Sunday brunch: We took a quick cruise around Rittenhouse (we were staying at the Sofitel) and saw: Parc was too crowded, Rouge was too expensive and if I had mentioned Ruby Tuesdays or a breakfast buffet at Chez Colette, I probably would have gotten a smack upside the head by my friends.  I would have deserved it too.

Square 1682 seemed like a good choice - close proximity to hotel, empty enough so that we had ample time before we had to catch our trains, liquor license.

The Good:
-Excellent bloody marys.  Spicy and with enough hair of the dog.  Much better than the ones we had the day earlier at Jones.
-The free range braised short rib sandwich was delicious.  I had serious food envy because I only got a bite of it from a friend.

The OK:
-The concept of making your own fritatta (pick cheese, herbs, veggies and meat) could be fun, but seemed daunting when hung over.  The fritatta tasted fine, but I was expecting to look like Morning Glory -- puffy, golden and enormous.  This was like a flatter, slightly undercooked version.

The not so great:
Service - friendly, but it took forever to get water refilled and it was tough to get someone to stop so we could ask for ketchup (I know, but come on, if you're serving home fries, expect to be asked for ketchup).
-The grilled chicken sandwich.  To quote my friend, ""Why is it so black?  And why is it so small?""  The chicken was way overdone, dry and the basil aioli or pesto whatever they put on it proved to be just some very bright green coloring that didn't help make the sandwich any less dry.  Also, the housemade chips on the side were good but so oversalted that you could really only eat a few.

It was $25 each for an entree and a bloody mary, with tax and tip.  All in all, it's exactly what I could have gotten at any hotel restaurant in nearly any somewhat metropolitan city.  Eh.

It's not Square 1682's fault, but why is it so easy to find awesome brunch with a free bloody mary or mimosa for under $20 in NYC and nearly impossible here?",2010-04-19 13:42:31

 The very start of our evening started out ok, everyone relatively friendly. They seated us in the back between the kitchen doors and the runners station.  So had to duck most if the evening as well as listen to waiters complain about customer. To be honest there should not be any tables in this location,  almost like being seated next to the bathroom.
 We ordered our food at 8pm and had not been served until 9pm! I was a little disappointed because this restaurant came so highly recommend,  but the food was good, to be fair. The service however needs to be drastically improved to say the least.  
 As I cut into the meat I noticed it was completely raw in the midde ( pictures included) and I had already eaten a few peices. I spoke to the manger and he informed me that,""he was sure the peices I ate had been completely cooked!"" I was not reassured by his statement.
 I would stay away from this restaurant as I could go and get better service and food at any mom & pop shop for half the price.",2014-08-23 05:03:38

We waited almost an hour for our food and 1/2 her salmon was barely cooked. The waitress says- ""well, we fix it medium rare"". I can tell you. I order salmon at most every restaurant go to and that was not medium rare it was almost sushi. In their defense they did offer twice to replace it, however at this point we were already irritated at the fact that we waited so long, we were not going to wait another hour for a piece of fish. I got the Boeuf En Croute. I ordered this because it was supposed to be braised ribeye. It was absolutely horrible. I could have made a better rump roast in my crock pot. It was dry and very tough. As far as cocktails the only specialty drink we ordered was the rainbow room. It was nothing to write home about. Finally, the check comes and they charge us for the duck as well as the raw salmon.

aiergL-p99WYHtowYZS14A,c6nXDNLg5CGbegyI3tLSEw,ehhztfVpm2UjKvSg7FEbVg,1.0,2,0,0,"I bought 2 of my cars to them today.  The 1st one I needed a caliper among other things.  I have done plenty of work on cars in my younger years so I know about auto repairs.  I know a caliper for my car costs about $50.00.  You pay about $90 for the caliper but there is a $40 core charge, which means you pay $90 for the caliper but then you bring or send  the the broken caliper that you take off the car back to the place you got the new caliper from and they give you back $40.  This makes the cost of the caliper $50.  I checked the price today and of the many places I checked the most being charged was $50 after the core charge is returned. Pep Boys charged me $127 for the caliper, just for the part.  When I asked for the old caliper back so I can return for the core charge refund they said they need to return it to get the core charge refund.  I asked how could the $127 they charged me be taking the core charge refund into account.  The guy told me the caliper they had to get was expensive.  There is not a place around that charges more then $50 for the caliper for my car after the core charge is returned.  The normal mark-up for a part by a shop is 25%.  At $127 Pep Boys marked the price up almost 3 times what they paid for it and maybe more considering $50 is the retail price of the caliper, after core charge refund; and I am sure Pep Boys did not pay full retail price for it. Even if Pep Boys paid full retail for the caliper at $50 with the 25% markup they should have charged me no more then $62.50.  Pep Boys took the normal price with the 25% mark-up and doubled it. ($62.50 * 2 = $125 and they charged me $127)  I asked where they got the part from and they would not tell me.  I also had a state inspection done, oil change, and replaced the brake pads and rotors on the front and back wheels so it was not like this was a small repair that they needed to mark-up to make a good profit.  They charge $100 an hour labor and charged 1.5 hours of labor for each set of brake pads they replaced when the auto repair time manual shows 1 hour of labor time required not 1.5 hours.  Five years ago when I still changed my brake pads myself I could replace brakes and rotors in 45 min per axle. This was a $917 repair bill.just for this car and I had a 2nd car to still pay for.

My 2nd car to be repaired that day needed rear brake pads and rotors.  The common price for the rotors for my car is $45 per rotor, $90 for a set of 2.  Auto Zone charges $45 per rotor. Pep Boys tried to charge me $167 for two rotors.  Please note the rotors are a stock item for Pep Boys and you can get the rotors in the Pep Boys store for $53.59 each or $107.18 for two.  I just looked it up online.  First you will notice Pep Boys charges $17.18 more for the two rotors then Auto Zone charges.  Assuming a standard 50% mark-up Pep Boys pays $53.59 for the two rotors.  They probably pay less due to their buying power as a large chain store and considering Auto Zone sells the same rotors for $90 for two they probably cost $45 for two wholesale..  On rotors Pep Boy's is charging over 3 times, and if they pay $45 for two rotors, almost 4 times what they pay for them if you have their service department replace them.  You probably noticed by the above that the Pep Boys service department charges $167 for the same rotors you can buy in the store for $107.18.  Why do the same rotors cost $60 more when the service department rings up the sale rather then the store?  Pep Boys already marked the rotors up by at least 50% to sell them in their store so why are they marking them up even more when the service department sells them to you?  You are already paying extra for the labor so there is no reason to mark the part up another $60 over what they sell for in the store.  If the rotors cost $107.18 in the store they should cost $107.18 in the service department plus the labor to install them not $60 more for the part.  I asked if I could purchase the rotors elsewhere since the price Pep Boys quoted me was so high and the guy said sure.  I bought the rotors at Auto zone for $90 for two and gave them to Pep Boys.  Pep Boys then tried to charge me $100 labor to install the rotors.   I was already paying to have the brake pads replaced and once the brakes are taken apart you just remove 1 clamp to remove the old rotor and attach the new one, which takes 5 min per rotor not 1 hour.  The 1.5 hours charged for brake pad replacement includes the time to replace the rotors already.  It was clear Pep Boys did not expect me to know that when brake pads are already being done and 1.5 labor hours is being charged there should be no charge for rotor replacement.  When they were charging me $167 for the rotors there was no labor charge but now that I provided the rotors there was a 1 hour labor charge to put the rotors I gave them on.  Why would I pay $90 for rotors at auto Zone to have them only take $67 off the bill instead of the $167?  This way it was costing me $37 more",2015-09-29 02:36:06

We ate here smack in the middle of the Manayunk StrEAT Food Festival.  Read: it was PACKED; in fact, I didn't know that many people actually existed in Manayunk.

I should say that the tacos themselves were quite tasty - we ordered one fish taco, one mahi mahi taco, and one pulled pork taco.  We meant to try a poblano chicken taco and chips with queso, but they were out of both (along with water.... come on guys).  I guess they found more chips, because I kept seeing people who came in just after us with orders of chips, so that kind of stunk. Anyway, the tacos were definitely pretty good, and combined with the fact that we were starving, they really hit the spot.  

HOWEVER, a major part of the reason we were so starving is because we waited 80 minutes for our tacos - I am not exaggerating here.  80 minutes for 3 tacos! Again, I realize this was during one of the most insane rushes the place has probably ever seen, but their organization and system was really lacking.  Everyone seemed nice, but they needed to get some cojones and be a lot more assertive in terms of delivering food to their many waiting patrons.  Maybe just yell out the ticket number as the orders come up rather than meekly wandering through a huge crowd searching for the magic ticket number? Things probably could have worked a lot more efficiently.  Just some food for thought. 

Overall, waiting 80 minutes for 3 tacos was incredibly lame, but at least I scored a good seat and was with great company and when we finally did get our food, it was pretty good.  Given the circumstances, all is forgiven and I would happily give Union Taco another chance if I found myself in the area (with a LOT of time to spare...wink).",2015-04-13 20:39:53

Past: Friendly and helpful neighbors the day we moved into this apartment two neighbors helped us move in without me asking it was a generous offer and we instantly became friends. The corner where my apartment was located had the best tenants folks helping each other out folks would pick up your package if it was lefted at your door and give it to you once you came home from work. We had planned cookouts we watched football and boxing in yard it was just perfect. We had weekly spraying by pest control and maintenance was on point we had no complaints at all.

Present: The old saying goes ""Damn they went from sugar to shit"" that sums up how we feel about the complex currently. We have two kids and we feel like we can't take them outside to play for a couple reasons. First they tore down the playground months ago and haven't replaced it. Which sucks bad for us still don't know if we are getting one in return. Second reason is oddly the main reason.
 ""Who let the dogs out?"" seems like within the past 4-5months there has been a invasion of tenants that own dogs and i mean big dogs that as you would probably guess takes a crap ALL OVER THE PROPERTY which shouldn't be a problem if the owners would clean up behind their pets right?!?! Wrong!! This never happens ii have seen dog crap everywhere including in front of my apartment door. How can you play in the area where you have grass at when there's dog shit everywhere? My wife emailed the office about this matter and they sent out a email addressing her concerns has anything changed nope not one bit. Along with many huge dogs we have aggressive breeds here with three being pitbulls. One of the tenants owns two pitbulls he lives across from me as i am writing this review at 8:16am i hear the dogs barking in his apartment the same dogs that were barking at 1am this morning the same dogs that bark constantly ALL DAY i would hate to be the tenant directly next his apartment. We actually heard the neighbors arguing with them about the dogs barking all night smh crazy.  Some tenants are very irresponsible with their pets letting them run lose knowing damn well those dogs will potentially attack someone I've had a couple close calls with some dogs that we're being carelessly lose by some tenants. I can't take my kids out because who knows what dog is running free. Why should you feel like you can't enjoy your community which seems to have turned into a dog park. My suggestion about how the lack of cleaning behind dogs can be fixed.  Every tenant with a dog should be fine every month for dog crap being found all over the community. I know some my think that's harsh to fine everyone because I'm quite sure there are some who clean behind their dogs and shouldn't have to suffer from the actions of those who don't clean behind their dogs but we  need to have is ACCOUNTABILITY for all dog owners. 

So now that I've gotten all my doggish behaviors out lets move on.

 There was a nice gas bbq station added to the complex which was a major upgrade and everyone was so excited to use this grill. Smh it didn't last one year the grill has been broken since late summer of this year. Again no ACCOUNTABILITY for the use of the grill i had to ask management on several occasions to add another propane tank to the grill station because one wasn't enough and it would always be empty because of constant use and because of that the grill was always filthy and you would spend 40mins cleaning it prior to using it. So now here we are its nice weather outside and we can't use the grill because the rain has damaged it along with carless and rough tenants (quick thought please build a pavilion over the grill it will help it last longer and it will help during spring/summer seasons)


I can seriously continue but I've said enough things are bad and i don't see any changes coming soon. I've been here for 2 years and we are great neighbors we pay on time and don't cause any problems at all and as I type we have an open work order because our microwave has been out since Saturday and we haven't heard not one word from management/ maintenance since. I understand the hoildays are upon us but a simple email or call won't hurt anyone.",2018-12-27 03:23:30

When we complained about the excess charges it was clear the assistant manager and our server were trying to cover something up they were doing for their friends.  I regret not asking for a higher level manager before leaving. My mother was crying going home because she felt old because the manager and server tried to scam her on the bill to accommodate their friends.

So of course for my birthday I wanted to get my family and friends together because I THOUGHT I fell in love with the restaurant. Everything was going great and the server was nice, no hard feelings towards her. Mid dinner the server tells us that she can't separate the checks because its their ""policy."" For one no one informed us in the BEGINNING and for two it's really not that hard to separate checks it was only 14 of us. I'm a server and I work in a restaurant as well. It's your job to keep track of what everyone has. It's called being organized. But of course that's not the worst part! We asked to see a manager and then she proceeded to say she was the manager (she wasn't the manager). So the owner or whatever you want to call her comes by to try and resolve the issue. She was playing nice at first but when she saw that we were all getting irritated because she couldn't resolve the issue properly her demeanor switched. It's MY birthday so of course I walked over to the bar with my sister in law while they are trying to get everything figured out. As we're sitting there we hear other costumers as well as the bartender and the owner (who was also drinking at the bar and noticeably drunk) talking about our table with the bartender. Then the manager walks over to the bar takes a few sips of her wine.. how professional! Then proceeds to say ""I have to go take care of this situation"" in front of all the guests at the bar. At that point I knew I wasn't going back to this place ever. So I went back to my table while they were trying to figure everything out STILL. My brother got really upset at this point. They put everything on his tab and then added an extra $100 to it. So basically they swiped his card for over $500 dollars and included a tip without his knowledge. It got really ugly after that, so everyone started arguing because what establishment does that? As we were walking out they were trying to kick us out I guess to make themselves feel like they had authority and had everything under control when they didn't. The bouncers or whatever you want to call it decided to get bold as we were leaving and walking away. Then the owner tried to keep $100 cash from someone in the party who had previously tried to pay cash even though everything was swiped under one card in the end. A member of our party had to physically take it out of her hand as she refused to give it back or even attempt to remind anyone that they still had the $100 cash. And then she threw my moms debit card in the road and said ""go eat McDonald's"" I guess trying to degrade us..  this was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. The owner was short, with short blondish/whitish hair. In her late 50's pushing 60 it seems. This place is awful!

The good: The decor is super cute. Several of the cocktails (mainly the Kitty Coupe de Ville) are really good. Some of the servers are quite nice.

The meh: The cocktail list is _short_, and several options just aren't very good. The cocktail of the day is often pretty blah. Food quality is inconsistent; their veggie burger was great the first time I had it and dry, flavorless, and sad the second. All the better menu items are also available at Milk & Honey and Alcazar, both of which have more, better food and drink options and much better service.

The awful: Since last fall or so, service at the Bourbon Room has been absolutely glacial. I'm talking waiting, and watching all the other tables wait, for everything until everyone's just uncomfortably shuffling in their seats, wishing they'd settled on eating popcorn at home instead.

They also charge another refundable $200.00 security deposit plus another illegal non-refundable pet security deposit of $300.00 if you have a pet.. So, they collect $450.00 that the tenant will never see again unless they sue or report this property, maybe. They take advantage of people with low incomes or low credit scores by claiming to be affordable and offer low starting rent but add on water, sewer, trash and pest control at the cost of the tenant which is normally paid for by their competitors. If you happen to have a pet you must add another $20 to your rent and for three months you can also add $100 for a payment toward the illegal non-refundable pet deposit. For example, my first moth's rent came out to $799.00 for a two bedroom apartment without central air and windows that will not stay open. My electric bill for June was $130 and that includes running two wall a/c units. So, if you can stand the heat of the summer then you might have a lower bill. I have never paid so much in my life for a place that advertises affordability. I must warn others before they get sucked into something that is too good to be true...I am still not sure how a business can get away with the illegal withholding of security deposits but I will conduct further research with this matter. My shower, toilet and kitchen faucet has not worked properly since I moved in and I have put in multiple requests just to be told the are too busy. I am willing to wait for good service for a reasonable amount of time but my shower randomly shoots out scalding hot water and I have two small children to be concerned with and do not want them burned. I told management about this weeks ago but since they are under staffed and taking care of the most recent fire here, we have had to hope that will will not get burned if we want to shower here. The minor issue with the plumbing is very low water pressure. The on-site laundry is convenient until you add up the costs of washing and drying one load: 1.75 for wash and 1.70 for drying equals 3.45 per load...and there are only eight washers and eight dryers and 200 units using them. Keep in mind this property has no extra storage so utilizing the nearby bike trail would be difficult without a place to store your bike..The management team refuses to clean the outside of the tenant windows so they are fifthly from who knows how many years of dirt..This is disappointing because I looked forward to seeing the greenery out of my windows..but instead I see green through a filter of dirt and grim... As for handicap parking, my son has a handicap place card and we have waited almost two months for management to place a plaque over the one spot by our building designed for handicap parking. There are no ramps near or in any of the buildings either for those with a physical handicap. The asphalt is painted to reflect a disabled parking spot but the other tenants do not care or notice and continue to park there illegally. With the amenities of the pool and park like setting it is disappointing that we will not renew our lease in 2016 since there are too many issues that will not change. I would just advise future tenants to do their research and ask tons of questions before considering this property. It can be tolerable and decent for some but it is not affordable or competitive with most other complexes in this area. Many other places include water, sewer, trash, and pest control in the initial rent and do not sneak the costs in later, and other places follow the laws and do not charge any type of illegal non-refundable deposit.",2015-07-01 20:40:50

The second time: I ordered hummus and received hummus past its expiration date. It tasted sour. Of course, the waitress was nice enough to take the appetizer off of the bill, but I was still disappointed.

The third time: The hostesses told us we would wait 10 minutes; we waited close to 30. Then, we were given the wrong food. I ordered guacamole and pita chips and I received tortilla chips and salsa. My friend was supposed to get a chicken cheese-steak and she received a regular cheese-steak. We had to ask twice for napkins, silverware (I had a salad as well, so silverware was important) and ketchup. Lastly, our bills were really messed up. We split the check (because we were paying with our Diamond Dollars) and they charged my friend for two sides of guacamole. The waitress claimed she couldn't fix our bill (which is ludicrous).

The owner Phil, seems to be a good guy and the quality of the work seems to be good...BUT...
If you're in rush, have plans, make an appointment, disregard all that! No matter how I approach it (I've tried a few times), whether I drop the car or wait for it, whether I have an appointment or not, it takes forever!!
Latest ""experience""...
I drop off the car Wed night (after calling two weeks prior AND the Mon before) with the stated expectation of picking it up after work as I had meetings and plans that evening...
I left a note with the keys requesting a Thurs AM phone call with the estimated cost before work begins...
First, I never got the phone call with the estimated cost, but more on that later...
When I arrive around 6:00pm Thurs evening for pick up, the car is still on the lift!
I then hear all about the tough day HE is having, but nothing about when the car will be done...
Long story short, I didn't leave with the car until 10:30pm!!!
I noted to him three times, he could have called me and told me that the car would not be done until late, then I could have pursued my needed plans for the evening, three times I noted that...
I noted that my plans were needed prior to my trip departure, that now my departure time will be pushed back by a few hours which cancels my pre-paid plans for Friday evening...
I noted that all that could have been avoided with just a phone call...
And about that requested estimate?
The final costs came in about 30-40% higher than I expected, 30-40% higher than I was led to expect in prior conversations...
So to summarize,
- no estimate as requested,
- a wasted evening and cancelled plans,
- final costs 40% higher than expected,
- travel plans delayed,
- pre-paid plans wasted...
As noted previously, Phil seems like a good guy and does what seems like quality work, just be prepared to spend MUCH, time AND money.,,

This was my second stay at this Hilton. The first was disappointing in that my bathroom sink was backed up with hair and disgusting buildup from former guests. I reported the issue to the front desk staff upon checkout. 

Because the location was ideal for a repeat trip to St. Pete, I thought I'd give the hotel another opportunity to stand up to the Hilton brand, once synonymous with luxury. The morning of my flight I phoned to confirm my reservation and reminded the female customer service rep that my previous stay was less than ideal. I asked that I be put into a room free of grime and plumbing backups. I was reassured that my room would be clean. 

Much to my chagrin, within minutes of settling in, I noticed two black hairs in and on the sink, purple shampoo residue on the shower soap dish, and creamy goop on the inside of the shower curtain. Urine had stained the sealant on the toilet lid fasteners. Some came off the toilet easily with a tissue. The facial tissues themselves were as gentle on my skin as a cat's tongue.

Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was impossible. Even with the heat turned up high for hours, the thermostat would not reach beyond 72 degrees. 

Although the bed provided a restful sleep and the linens were soft, black makeup stained one of the formerly pristine pillowcases. 

The television worked poorly and had little to zero reception on several of the twenty or so basic stations. There were no instructions on how to operate the tv and its functions were not self apparent. 

The hallway decor was obviously beautiful at one point. Now stained lampshades were left off kilter.  Overlooked and forgotten like the dirty martini glass waiting on the floor for a lift. It was there when I arrived. It was there when I checked out. 

When I tried to order room service 24 minutes before delivery was scheduled to end, nobody answered the phone. I ended up selecting a grab and go cold sandwich from the lobby pantry. As I approached the front desk to pay for my food, I relayed to the clerk some of the concerns I had about my room. She was sweet and comped my sandwich and chips. She also handed me a coupon for a free breakfast. I had eaten in that restaurant during my previous stay and knew to steer clear. Someone in that kitchen loves to use salt.

Had I not seen my bill, I would have sworn I was staying in a roadside motel. This Hilton may be nicely appointed with the latest in interior design, but the ick factor overshadows the shine.",2017-11-15 18:55:50

I spoke to Claud who then told me that cancellations were only done on Mondays over the phone - which seems dishonest considering I had been told first that cancellations could be done over the phone, then that they weren't. Now, they could only be done on Mondays? Not only that, but he was very unhelpful, brisk, and rude when I spoke to him. 
Later, my boyfriend called back in and was told the same thing by Claud, who transferred him to corporate. Thankfully, corporate was able to cancel his account immediately and did so kindly.

(dia de los muertos hot chicks on the walls and a menu boasting about Havanaesque Mojitos, I couldn't figure out where the ""Baja"" part came in, though, maybe the ceviche shots?) I've traversed Baja in person enough times to be wary of any place north of San Diego using Baja in the title. I was highly skeptical that any thing would be remotely authentic so I went safe-style and ordered two Corona Lights and their ""queso"" dip because happy hour means any drink is buy one get one for $.25, and the appetizers are pre-made in mass quantity and would be at the table QUICKLY (till 7).  Half a star for a cool happy hour. (Word is they have drinks ready for those of us who work night shifts and are looking for a ""nightcap"" at 7am another half star there)

The wait service only exists on the patio. If you sit within the roofed area (patio was full so the kiddo and I went ""inside"") you must order at the bar where two high-waisted shorts girls in tiny tank tops and tons of foundation and mascara are not only taking the orders of the long line of hungry patrons but also serving plastic cupped Jose Cuervo 'ritas to those sitting around the bar. It took a solid 15 minutes to be acknowledged by one of them to place my order. Management needs a dedicated person to take orders and then dedicated bartenders. The current setup is retarded.

Hats off to the guy who wrote the menu, he was definitely a sweet talker and scam artist. That said, I ordered the queso, which according to the menu writer, had the OPTION of adding chorizo. Vegetarians beware, the happy hour queso includes chorizo, whether you want it or not. Baja Sharkeez nearly saw my half digested stomach contents three bites into my queso dip when I realized that was pork I was eating. FOUL. I can't figure out how I talked myself in to stopping here and actually eating the food.

Anyway, the meat eaters nearby seemed content with their food, but nobody had smiles. There were about eight separate tables reserved for groups and I do know this spot blows up on weekend nights, still not too sure why. (college kids) My daughter liked her microwaved food, ""OK,"" I guess. But she's ten, and ""chicken"" tenders are ""chicken"" tenders.

Final word: I will LIKELY go to Baja Sharkeez again to watch a Dodger game and stick STRICTLY to bottled drinks or simple shots of hand picked liquors. It's nothing to write home about but I like places that feature the Dodger games on their biggest screen so they at least get one more star for that.",2012-08-11 05:06:15

We recently bought a 2014 Dodge Ram 2500 diesel from them after spending 6 hours at the dealership on a Saturday waiting for the financing to go through my boyfriend who is a mechanic went to check to see if the truck already had the undercoating installed that had been offered to us. When he was looking under the truck he noticed some coolant he got back and mentioned it to the finance guy who talked to service and they said some must have been spilt during the inspection okay fair enough. We were assured time and time again that the truck was fully inspected. Well we go to pick up the truck on the following Monday we're told we're all good to go so we start the truck with the starter and it almost immediately shuts off. Turns out the safety shut off over rid the starter because there was no fuel in the truck. When the lady we dealt with in sales the truck threw a check engine light so they put in in the shop and found it was only a battery code from the truck being dead. We take the truck home and the next day my boyfriend finds where the coolant was coming from and fixed it himself and then a couple days later when we were driving a service electronic breaking message kept coming up and the cruise control would not work so we booked it in to be serviced. When we brought in the truck they got us to pull up to the door making it seem like the truck was going to be seen today like the lady I booked it with said they had time to do that Friday. We hung out in the city because we do not live close to the dealership and were called a few hours later saying the truck was not going to be seen until Monday to top it if they had no loaner vehicles and would not rent us anything to drive. The dealership reset the computer that was causing the problem and In the mean time they found a transmission leak that was missed by the first person who inspected the truck. We get the truck back and a day later it is doing something it wasn't doing before the computer update the screen on the dash is flashing. Turns out it is the gauge cluster that they quoted us $1600 for and they will not do anything about it or for us. Not even an offer to cover the cost of labor which I have been informed by another dealership that it is only a 1 our job. Needless to say we do not recommend Southtown Chrysler to anyone as it has been an overall terrible experience from the time we signed the papers. Not only were major things over looked in their inspection they do not do anything to help out their customers.,2019-03-08 01:35:48

A few days later another broke off and I'm not involved in tasks at school or work that cause my hands or nails to subject to rough activities at all.

The food is good, but despite the rave reviews on staff, they've been lackluster. Every time I've ordered, I've ordered ""Curbside"" which to me, means that a restaurant employee brings the food to your car. Wonderful! I'm a high risk for COVID-19, so the less contact with people, the better for me. The order directions even state to call when you arrive, and someone will bring it out to you. The first time we picked up, we sat on hold for about 8 minutes and then someone brought it out. (We later discovered we were shorted a drink). The second time we were hung up on after being on hold for ten minutes. On hold the third time for over ten minutes.... see a pattern here?  Of course every time, we end up having to go in and get it, which is not ideal, but every time we go in, no one is busy. They are sitting and spinning. Here's my hypothesis: The lady answering the phone answers, (I can only assume realizes that my name is the same as my pickup order name), and then parks the call and continues to chat with colleagues, hoping we give up and just come into the building. When we go in, usually she says something like ""oh your order is over there for pickup!"" But today when we pointed out that we were actually still on hold with her, she said ""oh that have been my co-worker"" despite her being the only lady in there. Well, ""curbside pickup"" is not ""come inside pickup."" My advice is either don't offer curbside pickup on your ordering app, or train your employees to actually perform. I wanted to recommend this place despite the service issues, but today, even the food sucked. It was cold even though I ordered it and picked up before the time slot.

The vehicle was fine during the test drive, but after I initiated the purchase is when all the problems with Advanced Auto Brokers surfaced.

I applied for a loan, and they ensured me that they would only check with their credit companies, and that my credit score wouldn't take a hit. That was the first lie. I didn't get approved for the top tier credit, so they applied me for sub prime. I received at least notifications over the coming months from companies explaining that I was denied for an auto loan. My credit score took an immediate 75 point hit after my purchase (possibly not related to the many inquires, but unsure).

During the purchase process, the loan person and I negotiated the price down to one I was happy with! Then the owner came in later and said ""I can't do that price, it's below my cost"", and the person entering the price said ""I didn't type that number in the system, it was a mistake"". The person selling me the vehicle even went so far as to show me THEIR cost for the vehicle on his computer screen, and the agreed upon price was about $500 over their cost.

After the owner came back in and said that they can't do that, we agreed on a price about $1300 higher than what I originally agreed to.

The contract had to be rewritten at least 4 times do to pricing errors like this. The person entering the data claimed he entered the right numbers, but each time it came back too LOW. 

After spending 5-6 hours working on this deal (my family was waiting in the waiting area mind you), I finally drove home with the new vehicle. This was after they put air back in the tires to make the air pressure warning light turn off of course. I didn't think about it, but during my test drive, I saw the light on and just thought that it had been sitting a while, now I'm certain they lowered the air pressure to make it a softer ride (NOT SAFE!). I've seen other dealerships do this too.

On the way home a check engine light came on, the catalytic converter were bad.... a three thousand dollar repair. This light will stay off on short drives, but after they heat up, the light comes on again. The had to have known about the issue as the lights ALWAYS return on.

Two months after my purchase, I still had not received my plates, so I called this company and asked about them. ""Oh, they came in, but you owe $200 more before we will ship them to you."" They said I paid too little to the state when I bought it or something.

The owner has a calming voice, and friendly demeanor, but he's the only one in the place that is welcoming like that, and I believe it's a facade.

I would never return here, and I don't recommend anyone purchases their vehicles here. I spend probably $1500 more on the vehicle than I had to, and now have a $3000 repair bill that I can't cover right away. I did purchase an extended warranty immediately, but of course the catalytic converters aren't covered.",2016-10-17 12:54:59

I purchased 2 stationary ""Allegra"" stationary chairs @ over 900.00 each, including tax & delivery.  The selected fabric was a bold stripe pattern.  When the chairs arrived, half of the stripes on the back/top of the chairs alighed perfectly, while the other half did not.  In addition, the ""stuffing"" at the right and left ""shoulders"" of the back is uneven.  These issus exist on both chairs which points to a lack of care in the manufacturing process.  If they can get half of the upholstry correctly applied, why not the other half?  When I phoned the sales person, she wanted nothing to do with it, and referred me to the store manager.  The store manager started lying right off the bat.  First, he said that I was told at the time of the sale, that LZB does not guarantee that patterns will match up on upholstered furniture.  This is not true.  I had a friend there with me and the manager was not even present at the time of the sale, nor did the sales person mention anything to this effect.  In fact, I told the sales person what bad luck I have had lately purchasing furniture, and she assured me that LZB stands behind its quality and that I would be pleased with my purchase.  When I pushed back with the manager and told him this was not discussed, I asked him to point out on the sales check where it states that LZB does not guarantee that patterns will be matched up in customary fashion for upholstered furniture.  There is no such statement.  The only thing about quality on the sales check is that LZB reserves the right to bring defective products up to their standards, but there is no verbiage about what their standards are.  Apparently it is whatever they want them to be.  To get rid of me, the manager agreed to have someone from ""service"" call me to make an appt. to come out and take a look at the chairs.  After several weeks, I started calling to find out status.  I had to make numerous calls, because ""service"" doesn't answer the phone at this location.  I finally caught someone who answered, and made an appt. to have someone come out.  They showed up on the appointed date, and snapped a few pictures of the chairs, but spouted the party line that, LZB assumes that everyone puts furniture against a wall vs. in the middle of a room, which is why they don't take much care on the upholstry of the back side of the chair.  That was a new lie/development.  He told me the photos would be sent to LZB and someone would contact me with a ruling on whether or not they would be willing to fix the poor workmanship.  2 months went by, and I called LZB corporate who had no record of my complaint so I logged a new one.  They even gave me an official-sounding tracking # and told me someone would contact me within a week.  It has been another month and no contact.

HOWEVER, Since purchase I have now noticed that the Trek spec sheet specifies an Ultegra front derailleur for the 2008 Trek Portland, and alas, mine has a 105 front derailleur. Seeing as though the rest of the components are 105, maybe something took the Ultegra that rightfully should be on my 2008 Portland, and a 105 was thrown on in the hope that I wouldn't notice. Well i did. Then again, maybe it's a honest mistake........

They obviously haven't been around much, nor experienced really good food. 

I came in with high expectations because this is such a historical and raved-about place, but I was highly disappointed in the food at the Seahorse. I would have liked to give it more stars for the great location and staff/service.  Other than that, the food was worse than ""meh.""

The Seahorse has been a local staple, frequented by locals and tourists alike for decades. I think they are at the point where they just don't care about the quality of food, because they know people will keep coming here, after getting recommendations from Trip Advisor and local hotels. Plus there are not many other breakfast/lunch restaurants to choose from in this area within close proximity. The locals will continue to come here out of loyalty and convenience, and tourists will continue to chose the Seahorse because of the aforementioned suggestions.

Everything was super bland and tasted like it was out of a can. It was not awful food, just not good food. I could have made a better breakfast at home. And the home fries that everyone is raving about? I've had ten times better at numerous dives around the country.  The corned beef hash is literally out of a can.  At least they could have doctored it up and added some signature spices, veggies, whatever. But sadly, it was just overcooked canned food.  And the toast is. at best,  basic: it's not even the thick Texas toast style that many other breakfast places offer. Even the coffee was bland.  It would be a great draw if they added flavored or specialty coffees, like  cappuccino or even Kona coffee, and created a little coffeehouse atmosphere. My boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy.  Again, canned and bland, and the biscuits were tough with lukewarm gravy.  There is just no originality here, not with the decor nor with the food. Save your money; go to Denny's for more variety, flavor, and quality.

I hate to be so harsh, because the location is great, the staff was friendly and hard-working, and service/seating/parking were flawless. But the food quality did this place in. Although it is quaint and cute and a local favorite, I will not be back.",2014-07-31 22:31:07

I should mention: I've never been into this particular store, but had an experience while making a donation worth at least mentioning.

It was Christmas Eve day (seriously) and I had an agenda of errands. One included a donation drop-off at Goodwill. I called at around 1:30 PM to inquire if they were even open; the lady answering the phone said they were open till 2:00, and that I could come before then.

I hurried up Keystone Avenue to make it on time, arriving at 1:53 PM. I pulled around to the drive-up to find two other cars waiting. One lady was talking to someone through the door. Long story short -- the person on the other end was nothing short of a prick. Acting like a child, blaming the supervisor, etc -- he refused to open the door and accept more donations, even though I told him that a) I called and was told I could arrive before 2:00 and b) that I would help him take everything inside. He again refused, and, after refusing to go get the supervisor, disappeared into the store. I should mention one of these other cars was a fully loaded minivan of ready donations. This person walked away from three cars full of ready-to-donate items.

I was APPALLED! While I completely understanding wanting to go home on Christmas Eve, this was 2:00 PM, not 6. Oh yeah, and it's GOODWILL!!! Seriously, with that attitude, go be a hipster at the Apple Store!

I was so angry I just left my stuff (2 small bags). Then I decided to call the supervisor. It was the same lady who had answered the phone before, telling me I could arrive before 2:00. I explained the entire situation; she asked me to describe the employee. She thanked me, said she'd take care of my stuff and that particular employee.

-I booked using a combo of miles+cash through American Airlines. I paid for two ocean view rooms, but when I called the hotel to confirm they told me that they couldn't give me these rooms since they don't control the third party website that I used to book.
-I booked two rooms since I would be attending a wedding in SB and needed my parents to look after my newborn daughter (our first hotel night away from home). I called 3 times to confirm that the two rooms would be next to each other on the first floor and was told each time that everything was all set. I even spoke to the manager on one of those occasions (or so I was told).
-Upon arrival I was told that they had no record of my calling and no notes on my account. As a result, they did not have two rooms close together. To add insult to injury, they charged close to an additional $600 on my credit card AND my mother's card for some reason that I still do not understand. Both charges were eventually waved, but it added unnecessary time and confusion.
-I spoke to the manager who at one point suggested I look for another hotel that might have rooms closer together. This was at 2:30p.m. and the wedding was at 4:00p.m. Suggesting that I leave the hotel after I had already paid for two rooms and search for another hotel in SB with my baby was absurd.
-They eventually gave us two rooms that were in the same building, but not close together. The rooms themselves were absolutely terrible - dirty, dark, and tiny. We had no other choice than to stay and make it work since we were already late to the wedding.

Our first night away with our baby was incredibly stressful and disappointing. If you are visiting the SB area, there are SO many hotels to choose from. I urge you not to give your business to this hotel.",2021-08-25 09:18:05

The staff is kind and informative and I appreciate their friendliness. When doing my eyebrows, they did a pretty decent job but nothing that really impressed me. I've been having poor experiences lately with eyebrow waxing so I was hoping that I could have someone thread but they weren't able to do it that day.

My eyelash extensions experience went very well. The lady was patient and explained the different options I had and what to expect in terms of how long it would last. The ONLY downside is that I felt like they should've explained any potential side effects of doing extensions. I experienced a lot of itching once I got home (I'm sure it was due to the glue). I am lucky that I didn't experience anything worse, which can happen so be sure to always do your research on these things and ask questions. 
When the woman put my extensions in she was very patient and gentle and made the experience very relaxing. I didn't fall asleep (because I was a bit nervous lol) but I did experience a lot of relaxation, so that's definitely good. :) 

The downside is that she told me my extensions would last two weeks. Well, the first night that I got home.... two of my lashes fell out. :( So that was upsetting and then over time the lashes continued to fall out long before the two week mark. Within about 4 days, one eye had noticeably less lashes than the other, so it felt like it was a waste of money. 
Then, I was frustrated because there were two lashes on my left eye that REFUSED to fall out. They lasted longer than 2 weeks and it was frustrating since it was only TWO long lashes so it made my face look uneven. I will say, they DO offer to take out the lashes for you BUT it cost $10 (which isn't bad) but I didn't want to pay $10 for taking out two lashes. 

I don't plan to do extensions again since I felt like I started losing lashes within hours of getting them BUT it's a lesson learned.

I don't know if I would recommend this place for others, simply because I feel like the quality of the waxing and eyelash extensions isn't up to par. I feel like you can find a better salon elsewhere.",2018-02-01 06:45:07

The tables were sticky, the windows look like they haven't been cleaned in quite a while and there were an ample supply of flies! In addition, when I asked where the bathroom was, they told me outside in a separate building. I got the key, went outside and was appalled at how filthy the bathroom was. Can't imagine how they can pass any inspection. So, if you're not concerned about cleanliness, and less than average food, this may be the place for you.

My first time at Continental Midtown was 10 years ago, when the food and service was still good.  The last time I had dinner at this location, was likely 4 years ago, and it was awful.  My boyfriend swore that the food was still good, so I begrudgingly agreed to eat here.  When we first walked inside, we were ""greeted"" by a miserable hostess who took forever to enter our information.  The restaurant was empty, and we seated at a small table on the first floor next to a very loud party of 8.  There were booths available, and many parties of 1 and 2 were seated at booths.  While we waited for our server, we noticed 5 or 7 staff people doing a fine job of looking busy.  There was 1 server working both floors, and not once in 15 minutes did he stop by our table.  Eventually he stopped by our table, threw down two glasses of water, and told us ""I'll be right back"".  No introduction, no apology, nothing.  Another 10 minute went by before he returned.  By that point, we were ready to walk out of the restaurant.  We moved across the aisle to a booth where it was less noisy.  After another 15 minutes, our server returned, with his shit attitude in tow, and took our order.  We ordered the hummus, cheesesteak egg rolls, and the quesadillas.  10 years ago, these were safe standby items, and they were always great.  The hummus was bland and the cucumbers were piss warm.  The cheesesteak egg rolls were overcooked and oversized.  And the quesadillas were off.  The entire experience was horrible, and a complete waste of money.  At the end, my boyfriend looked at me and said ""you were right - this place has gone to hell in a hand basket.  We'll never come back"".  The food at Starr restaurants is usually great.  The service is hit or miss, as most Starr servers think of themselves as the creme-de-la-creme of restaurant servers, and that's shown in their attitude.

Back in September, my wife and I placed a takeout order which included our usual favorite entrees and a few slices of cheesecake. Her entree - a chicken sandwich - had two toothpicks placed through it to hold it in place. However, one of the toothpicks was broken and hidden within the sandwich; the upper half with the flag was missing. We removed the one toothpick we saw and she proceeded to bite into it, discovering this toothpick fragment the hard way. It punctured her gum line and hurt like hell - but she thankfully avoided a visit to urgent care. Needless to say, we were really upset when this happened and left half of our food uneaten. Who leaves a broken toothpick inside a sandwich?

Shortly afterward, I returned to CF with all of our remaining food - including the sandwich with evidence of what had happened. I explained the situation to the manager and she promised me a full refund, expressing concern for my wife's condition and assuring me that they would address this situation appropriately in the kitchen to avoid future incidents. She offered to mail us a gift card as a gesture of goodwill, but we thought that was weird (why not just give us one in person?) and we were hesitant to accept it. I eventually agreed and provided my address. She promised to follow up in the morning to make sure my wife was all right.

Unfortunately, we did not receive either the refund or the gift card. I then contacted their corporate office in California to resolve the issues and raise my concern that this situation was not being handled appropriately. The corporate contact assured me that the restaurant would retrain their staff to prevent future incidents and promised to follow up on both the refund and the gift card.

12 days after the incident, I followed up again with a voicemail asking why the refund had not been processed yet. The contact did not return my call. Instead, I received a notification of a processed refund the next day. We never received the gift card we were promised.

I honestly expected better from Cheesecake Factory. No other business I know of would take 13 days to process a refund after an incident like this, much less, require repeated pressure to make
it happen. It's also upsetting that they never sent the gift card, because it confirms that they really don't value us enough as customers to encourage us to come back.

I suggest spending your money somewhere else. There are plenty of other local restaurants, including other big chains, that are happy to meet or exceed basic expectations for how you treat your customers. Cheesecake Factory didn't lose just two customers permanently - they lost over a dozen and counting, all for repeatedly failing to do the right thing.",2021-12-15 21:25:10

It seems to me that you only like it when you guys receive positive reviews. You and your staff are not able to handle when someone is telling you that they were treated poorly and didn't like the service. This is business 101. You and your staff should figure out where you guys dropped the ball instead of putting energy into going back-and-forth with me on a public platform. You should probably invest that energy into making sure that unfortunate things like this don't happen again. I would not recommend this place to an enemy. We did not deserve that treatment, and the fact that you're trying to justify it reflects poorly on you. Learn how to take criticism and charge the issues instead of arguing with multiple customers on your short comings. You failed as a leader because you are not  people directing your team, instead you are telling them that customer are not always right. But what can I expect when their leader does not know leadership. I would not advise anyone to visit this restaurant because of the lack of compassion that was given from the owner or co-owner of this establishment. There is no need to try to win me back over as I am already done. Again I do not want or need your apology, but you should do better for the sake of the business and not desire treat them in the manner that you have. 

{Update #2} 
I just received a private message from the ""co-owner"" of this establishment which definitely shed a ton of light on the situation that happened. If the leader does not practice good customer service then the staff WILL NOT!! This makes so much sense because we were treated horribly by the staff here and nothing was being done about it. But this message I was just sent from the co-owner explains why. She does not take pride in serving others so why should the staff. Horrible and sad! She has fallen as a leader. 

      -Response: ""I was out of town when you visited our restaurant. My response was not rushed as I waited until after speaking to all employees involved. 

I did not blame you 'just for coming to the establishment' but simply explained the situation to you in it's entirety. 

I am quite aware of what customer service is and should be. My staff does as well. We aren't always perfect, but that's because we're human.

I do not promote a 'customer is always right' mentality because, simply put, they aren't. Customers are human too. Clearly mistakes were made in this situation by guests and staff and for that we apologize.

Enjoy your Sunday,
Maria""

{Update} 
I really appreciate your urgency to respond to this negative rating. However, the treatment we received was UNACCEPTABLE and that same urgency should been extended then! I appreciate that you pointed out that my replacement food was free and you hoped I enjoyed it, as I did not even eat it because it became cold as I'm trying to deal with rudeness and unprofessionalism for the staff. Forget the food, I'm just trying to get comfortable at this point. So if you're the ""co-owner"" then you should know a thing or two about decent customer service and leadership and should have lead your team on how to properly handle situations like this instead of blaming us just for coming to the establishment. I would recommend sitting down with your team and using this situation as a teaching tool on what NOT to do to your customers who thought well enough of this place to have our girls gathering there. This was heartbreaking to say the least. I don't need your apologies, just do better as a leader.",2018-03-25 18:36:17

The last time I went to Noodles and Company (quite a few years ago in my pre--Yelp days); it was probably circa 2013.   I now think I know why I didn't go back.  I was really hoping from the mixed bag of reviews, that it might end up being more better than worse.   I really do try to be a positive and hopeful person overall.  

I could rate my experience years ago as possibly a three star deal. 
But, honestly,  I really can't give them any more than two stars this time. 


Rated on a 10 scale, we had : 

1.  My choice was the - Japanese pan noodles.   
I read a few reviews on here and took the advice of one of the reviewers. 
My meal was not pleasant.  
I would rate it a weak 2.   
The overall flavor was super salty and the noodles had an odd taste.  
It was on the dry side and had no visible sauce in it whatsoever as well.  
They were tough/hard in texture also massive and thick in size.  They were thick ropy floury / pasty tasting type noodles similar to the frozen type brand - Reame's.   They were definitely a very poor choice for the dish.  Rice noodles would have been a much better and/or appropriate option.  
God help me when I ask myself AGAIN why I didn't just complain and send it back? 
OY. 


2.  My guest had the Pulled pork mac and cheese.  She liked it and thought it was tasty enough.  I tasted it too. I thought it was by far more worthy of a dish than mine.  
I would rate it a solid 8.  

The staff was unimpressive,  blase'  or barely even `there'.  ;o(
The decor / atmosphere is not anything more special than going to any given fast food joint. 

The pricing was off because the quality and amount of food did not compare.  
My guest had far more in her bowl than I did in mine.

We've eaten all over town and we understand and appreciate well prepared food, well made cocktails and solid service.  Unfortunately we were let down by all three.  

The bar is very small and the bartender was slow as he was constantly looking at the recipes figuring out how to make drinks and a bartender needs to be as efficient as possible as people all over the restaurant were waiting for drinks.  We also ordered a specific after dinner aperitif and they instead brought something else to the table and didn't mention that they didn't carry what I had ordered as they probably had hoped I wouldn't catch it.  I caught it, asked about it and then they told me they didn't carry what I had ordered so that's why they brought me what they did.  Unfortunate.

The food was fine/average at best but nothing special.  The street tacos were cold, the fish of the day was uneventful and plain, the pork had good flavor but was overcooked and stringy as it was sitting around too long but the scallops were cooked nicely and prepared well with nice flavor.  Dessert wasn't worth mentioning.  

The service was very slow and every time she stopped by our table, she was moving 500 mph so instead of acting calm and level headed, she was quickly running through the menu, forgetting things and this is with a restaurant that was only 70% full. The place was nearly cleared out by 9pm on a Saturday night. 

We were disappointed by this place and do not think we will give it a second chance unless they change a few things.",2016-04-21 12:36:49

I can't speak for their coffee, however, because my blood pressure situation doesnt allow me to have caffine, and THEY DON'T OFF ANY DECAFFEINATED COFFEE OR ESPRESSO!!!! All I could have was some decaf Plum Tea, which was actually fairly tasty but not anything close to what I wanted. 

I can speak for the decor. It's in what appears to be an old jiffy lube type garage. Hard walls, high ceilings, VERY echo-ey and loud. The furniture, again, is designed to look cool, but is absolutely NOT conducive for comfort and conversation. The side tables against the walls have a huge cable attaching them to the wall. They cut right through your line of sight to the person you're sitting with. WTF? 

So, if you're a poser and want to appear like you should be in L.A. instead of Nashville AND you have money to burn, go here. Otherwise, stick with the MANY other great coffee places in Nashville like, ""Edgehill Cafe"", ""Bongo Java"", or ""Portland Brew"".",2015-07-29 13:37:53

We were seated quickly and got to watch the parade antics out the open windows which was a lot of fun. Being right on Bourbon street, I came with very low expectations.

1. We had the worst waiter I've ever had. He was pleasant but obviously completely overwhelmed. I've waited tables before so I understand being overwhelmed but this is a tourist restaurant on Bourbon st; it's always going to be packed. If you're that in the weeds, you need to ask for help. We were very polite to him but I can only imagine that other customers reamed him out at some point. He took forever to acknowledge us, forgot things, spilled food and never cleaned it up, just really poor service. We probably sat there for 30 min before we got our drinks and butter for the bread that was getting cold on our table.

2. The food was ok. We ordered oysters on the half shell. I thought they weren't cleaned very well and pretty bland but they were a good size and reasonably priced. I had the turtle soup and gumbo. Both were tasty and good-sized portions for appetizers. I've never had turtle soup before so I can't compare it to other places. I thought the presentation was pretty terrible and the waiter spilled some of the gumbo on the floor as he set it down...then did not attempt to clean the plate at all or the spill on the floor. My friend had the jambalaya which I thought was the best thing that we ordered. I also ordered a sazerac; it was a bit sweet for me but tasty. We finished with the bread pudding which was good but underwhelming.

3. The good: for 3 appetizers, one entree, a cocktail, and dessert, our tab was maybe $60. For the French Quarter, that seems pretty good.

Overall: The food was good but nothing amazing. The place is loud but that's what you get on Bourbon street. However, for the price it seems like an OK deal. Just don't get our waiter.",2013-03-12 22:10:31

7h7lBJl1hKyB-abei03SKQ,qT5DvWRvpgm6mY6xeckyBw,-OKB11ypR4C8wWlonBFIGw,2.0,2,1,1,"We, my wife and I, love the Atlantis. We enjoy the gambling, the food is excellent, the people are friendly, the atmosphere is nice. We are out of towners and receive complementary rooms quite often, like once a month for multiple stays. That tells you that we like to gamble and we do. Sometimes we're lucky, sometimes not, but we always enjoy ourselves. It cracks me up when I see reviewers who complain about not winning in a Casino. That's why it's called Gambling, folks! Don't whine and moan because you lost your money. It was your choice to do so.

So why then would I give the Atlantis only 2 stars? For one reason and one reason only. They have the most ridiculous and, in my opinion, irrational policy concerning Handicap rooms in their hotel.  My wife is handicapped, she uses a walker and I also have a bad back that surgery did nothing to repair so walking for both of us is difficult. When we make reservations at any hotel we always request a Handicapped room. They are usually closer to the elevators, have lower beds so are easier to get into, have bathrooms set up for handicapped people with either sturdy bars to hang on to and low bathtubs to step into or walk-in showers (which are great), etc. 
Not so at the Atlantis. The handicapped rooms are fine BUT their Policy is to put the handicapped rooms the FURTHEST from the elevators. This is not a joke, even tho it sounds like one.  It is absolutely ridiculous.

The last time we stayed there, in October 2017, our room was the LAST room in a long series of hallways.  I honestly didn't think we would make it. When I went to the front desk to ask WHY? they said that was their policy and then gave me some ridiculous reason that didn't even make sense.
It makes me wonder if whoever came up with this brilliant idea even knows what it means to be physically handicapped?  A Physically ""HANDICAPPED"" person has an ailment, injury or condition that makes it difficult to live life in a ""normal"" manner and the #1 thing most have in common is difficulty walking. For my wife it's a degenerative disease that causes her much pain and walking has really become difficult. But she keeps fighting to have the best life she can, never complains, never gives up. I would love for whoever implemented this absurd policy to have her condition for one day and then walk to the room they gave us. No doubt in my mind, that policy would be changed the next day.

We go to Reno about once a month and stay in various hotels. There is NO other hotel in the Reno area that we've stayed that has this policy. The Grand Sierra, The Peppermill, The El Dorado, Boomtown...all places we've stayed this year. We ask for a handicapped room as close to the elevators are possible and that's what we get.

It's really a shame because the Atlantis is one of our favorites but unless they change this policy we will no longer be able to stay there or give them our business because we won't bother to go there if they can't accommodate us.
I do not recommend anyone with a physical handicap or even Senior Citizens to stay at the Atlantis. They will put you in a room as physically inconvenient as possible. 

I'm hoping someone from the Atlantis who can do something about this will read my review. Please take it seriously. You have no idea how difficult it is to be handicapped and your obvious inconsiderate attitude does nothing to help.",2017-11-08 21:36:09

Then when it's time to move out, this place steals your deposit. I'd recommend living anywhere but here. There is nothing in the lease about these fees that caused them to steal our deposit.

Well they're about to need a lot more money once we show our lease to our attorney. You need extra sanitation? YOU pay for it. Walmart isnt charging us to sanitize their carts!

Dear management: Respectable businesses are waiving rent, waiving late fees etc. People are hurting, this isnt the time for your greed, well let's be honest this is theft. Especially when there is proof that apartment was cleaner when we left than when we moved in. We will see you in court, and you will lose based on our lease agreement!

I have tried getting in contact with a member of the service department, but to no avail. I have left 4 voicemails, and had 1 callback that sent me to another voicemail. I understand that people are busy because I, too, am a busy working person. A simple call-back to understand what is going on with my car would have been great.

After bringing in my camper and them telling me they could find a part for me and fix my broken window they never called me never spoke to me other than when I called them. 
After waiting three weeks for them to call me I called them to find out what was going on and they said that nothing has been done giving me some runaround about people dying and people going on vacation and just the runaround. So I waited another two weeks called them again and this time they had done nothing again!! They needed to take measurements again because the guy that measured it the first time died which was four weeks ago!Why haven't they called me! Worse non-service ever!

My husband and I went to dinner on a Saturday night, really looking forward to enjoying the new addition to our neighborhood. We arrived and the host was very friendly and promptly seated us according to our reservations. Where we were seated was rather odd. It was a half booth spot, where one person is seated along the wall and the other was in a chair. However, the wall portion seat also was flanked by another wall (at a right angle), making it rather cozy and almost claustrophobic. Added to that, the booth seat dampened the noisy restaurant but the chair spot was still very noisy...it created many, ""WHAT??? SAY THAT AGAIN"" moments in our conversation. Also, the ambiance is really weird. It has this 1980's American Psycho vibe...gray walls and clean lines, but not in a modern way. Throw in a DVD on loop playing ""scenes of Northern and Southern Italy"" (I know the title because I saw it on the screen when they had to restart the DVD once it ended) on giant flat screens designed for soccer watching at a pub. But we just moved forward focusing on the menu. 

We reviewed the menu for about 5 minutes before the waiter came over. No introduction, nothing. ""What would you like to drink?"" we order and he leaves. We receive our drinks. He leaves again for about 5 minutes. He then comes back, reviews the menu a bit, then leaves again. Then finally comes back again after a few minutes and takes our order. NOTE: not once did we say that we needed more time to make our decision. 

We get our appetizers, and they are very good. The mushroom crespelle was great, as were the peppers alla nonna. The plates are cleared then the entrees come. Oxtail ragu with papardelle and osso bucco. Both good. VERY filling, but good. 

Then the end comes and we are left dessert menus, we definitely didn't need dessert so begged off. Our waiter wandered around a bit to set the tables around us without offering our check. We flagged him down AGAIN for our check. This is when the ""charm"" came from the waiter. He started gushing and was very chatty. Well, I guess since it was time for us to leave the tip, and all of his other tables and sidework were done, it was time to seal the deal. Nah. I didn't appreciate that. Ignore us the entire meal then talk to us for 2 minutes? No thank you.

I love croissants.  When I ran a bakery, my pastry chef spoiled me.  As a result, I have a high standards for croissants.  The plain croissant looked pretty good.  However, they were made with too little butter and not enough respect for fermentation.  There were no good butter or fermentation flavors in the plain croissant.  The only strong flavor in the plain croissant came from the non-traditional and unnecessary sugar glaze.  

By French standards, they were severely under baked, and they were a bit under baked by American standards as well. 

The almond croissant was a total mess.  These must be popular since I got the last one.  However, it was clear that the croissants had touched one another while rising and baking and were deformed.  Normally croissants are filled by rolling the filling into the croissant when it is shaped.   These had been sliced open after baking and filled with a substandard almond goo that was too thin, too sugary and not nearly almondy enough.  Then the goo held the croissant together.  Looking at their display case after having eaten my croissants, I saw that several other filled croissants were made the same way.  

Their tarts and other pastries looked good, however, I was so disappointed by the croissants that I am not inclined to try them.

Several people complained about the service they received.  That is, perhaps, the only thing I can't complain about.  The staff was helpful and kind.

In dithered about the score to give the bakery.  The bakery was clean and well run, and they are obviously producing the product they want to produce.  Their product didn't make me sick.  One star seems harsh.  But I don't think they are up to where they should be to get two.  If I could give them 1 1/2 stars, I would.

I was told that gift certificates never expire and I needn't worry, but I insisted that be marked on the certificate itself, so she begrudgingly changed it to March 31, 2021 (a 3 month extension).

During that 3 month time the shop location in Haddonfield closed, so in April I called the proprietor, Kathy, for an update and class location information. First, I got evasive answers about her relocating the shop somewhere she wouldn't say, and then when I mentioned the now-expired gift cert, she condescendingly snipped 'I told you before they never expire!'. When I countered that if that were true then why did she date it for March, she became melodramatic and accused me of yelling at her (funny, she was 'yelling' at me) and curtly told me that she would just give me a refund (as if I don't deserve to take her class for questioning her - lol). I readily agreed.

Based on the other Yelp reviews that I've now read, I'm so glad that we did not give this miserable and clearly troubled woman our money and patronage. I received a check from her and went straight to her bank and cashed it out. Done. 

We will go enjoy some red wine and cooking at Sur La Table.

All I wanted was subtle balayage to have that sun kissed hair color and a trim on my already existing layered hair. I told them at the very beginning that I did not want an ombre!! what she did to my hair was exactly that!!!  An Ombre!! And my layers have disappeared I don't know how to describe the cut I currently have. 

I made sure to communicate exactly what I wanted with pictures and selecting the hair color swatches to even saying what I didn't want. I had bleach on my hair for approximately 4 hrs, thats with 30 developer. I have had balayage at salon's before so I know what the process should look like. This was no where close. Kim, the instructor was there to assure me that I would not leave unsatisfied, at the same time she did not give constructive advice to the student when she needed it. Kim was there and she knew what I wanted. should have known better than to let the student go at such a slow pace with so much bleach in my hair!!

Eventually my stylist asked another student who was far more confident than her to help her with finishing my hair. And the new student stylist eventually did. The instructor and the new student stylist that stepped in to help decided amongst themselves what they wanted to do fix my hair without even consulting me.  They decided to have three different color toners in my hair instead of the two that I had actually asked for! But it was far too late, my hair was much much lighter than what I asked for. 

After 8hrs in this place I will still have to go to a different salon at some point to have the hair fixed!!! 

I will never return here. Do not trust anything they say. The hair damage really isn't worth it!!

I am not sure what they put in my hair but when I wash my hair there was a lot of brown color that washes off with every wash!! I was petrified to see my hair blonde near the nape of my neck. And places where they had missed the toner. My hair looks disgusting and fried!!

Visited on a recent Sunday night at 5:30 and sat in the upstairs dining area where the bar is (the upstairs bar was not open our visit).  Pretty room.  We ordered 4 drinks and waited 15+ minutes for them to arrive.

We all ordered the special.  A few minutes later, the waiter returned to say they were out of the special . . . had 2 left.  Mind you the restaurant opened at 5:00 and was nearly empty, so how they ran out is a mystery.  The two guys re-ordered something else.  Five minutes later, the waiter returned to say that they were out of whatever my husband re-ordered. 

Waited a little too long for salads to arrive but they looked good.  Unfortunately, my friend found herself chewing on a piece of paper towel in her salad, and a minute later I got the same 'treat' in mine.  The waiter took them all away and we said we didn't want more.

Meal finally came and was decent.  Portions were average.  Wanted to order additional glasses of wine but waiter nowhere to be found.  

Finally, as we finished our meals, the manager came over and said he was told there were some ""issues"" with our meals.  We explained the above, emphasizing that we were all pulling for the restaurant to make it because we're residents of Newtown, but the experience was unacceptable thus far.  He offered to comp us desserts, but we were having dessert at home so politely declined.  He sent them out anyway, forcing us to make a choice to eat them, box them, or waste the food.  We chose to eat them.

At the very least, he should have comped us our drinks, or taken a portion off the bill, but simply serving us desserts we said we didn't want didn't leave a good taste in our mouth for returning anytime soon, if ever.",2021-09-23 17:16:20

I moved and wanted to transfer my comcast service to my new apartment. My complex, however, changed the unit I was suppose to move in to. I contacted comcast about this issue and they kindly helped me. I wanted to install everything myself (because I did it before) but they insisted that a technician should come by. After the technician came and set everything up I noticed that the representative I talked to didn't cancel the appointment I first made for my wrong unit. She also gave me an entirely different account/bundle. I did not have the correct channels and I have phone service, which I did not want. So I called to get my previous bundle back or something similar. The first representative gave me the wrong bundle. She clearly said she was upgrading my channels and adding internet service. However, she gave me cable and phone. I had to call comcast back and they would question me on the multiple accounts I had. After being transferred back to back for 3 hours and put on hold, they finally resolved my issue but had to transfer me to activate my internet. I got disconnected after that. I called back and was transferred back to back again for another 2 hours. I asked for a direct number and they of course gave me an automated number. They kept insisting that I needed to talk to the sales department and that department insisted that I needed to talk to tech support. Finally someone in tech was able to help me by simply sending a signal to my modem. 

Another issue I had was that I wanted to upgrade my internet to a higher speed. It seems like everyone wanted to sell me a bundle with triple play, and they insisted that was the only bundle. One lady lied to me. She told me they can opt me out of the phone service I did not want and just have cable and internet. Then in the end she said I will have all three services. She also insisted that a technician has to come by to make sure it will work. A technician cost about $40. I cancelled the appointment and the upgrade because I was clearly lied to. After talking to a third person, I was able to just upgrade my internet and he just sent a signal to upgrade my internet free of charge. 

Anyways, now my internet seems slow again. I talked to someone about my issue and she seemed to have brought my internet speed (we used a website that test internet speed) from 5mbps to 50mbps. I informed her that when I upgraded my internet it said it would be 105mbps. She said, ""Oh that only applies to the western states.""

  The other stories are true.  You will see more shape-ups and popped collars there than at a rave on Long Island.  The place reeks of vomit and stripper perfume.  You have to wait forever for the self entitled slob of a bartender to wade over.

By the time the bartender serves all the 19 and 20 year olds their Jagerbombs and Long Island Ice Teas you are so parched you consider licking the sweat from the gyrating sorostitutes who won't stop backing that ass up all over you.  Luckily, I snuck my own beer in (a left over from the cab roadies).  So, beer in hand, my friends and I (who are only there so one of us can meet up with this girl) wander over to the other bar where the coyote ugly wannabes are projecting their self loathing all over the paying customers.  I leaned between the legs to order more drinks.  I had to order four beers just to ensure I didn't have to wait in that mess again.  I'm getting frustrated just writing this.  You get the picture.  The place sucks.  Bad.  Why come to the city to go to such suburban wasteland of a bar.  Push down your collar and get a little fucking taste.  And stop dancing on bars, girls.

I found a couple reviews where people had mentioned it here and there but I didn't think they have an infestation but nope these are full size infestation roaches. I don't know if every building is having this issue on the complex ground but also I called and reported maintaince requests to the office since not even two weeks after moving in both my large burners don't work and the light in the pantry is out.

This week I received another call to schedule the checkup on the air conditioning.    Once again I scheduled the appointment for Saturday between 2pm and 5pm.   This time someone did call to confirm on Friday that the technician would be there on Saturday.   So I rearranged my schedule to be home from 2pm to 5pm, but no one ever showed up.   I called the Intelligent Design office and after leaving a msg with their answering service, I received a call back from one of the techs who was very apologetic, and he asked me to call the office at 8am on Monday to reschedule.   Based on my experience once they have your money up front from the service contract that are not as motivated to follow through with what they promised on the maintenance program.    It will be interesting to hear what they have to say this time when I call back on Monday.",2015-05-03 12:15:57

When the front desk explained their policy in detail, I was unaware and surprised by it so I stated their website is misleading. I also spoke to the manager, and she said ""sorry, corporate policy"". She said they need to clean our room hypoallergenically by a company called ReNu. The Manager said it was corporate policy (although Marriott does not allow pets at all of their hotels). So I wonder if they it needs to be cleaned, do they clean the entire hotel? How about the hallway carpet too? Seems like a good idea to clean the room but I will tell you that our room needed to have basic cleaning of the carpet. It was very dirty and I was uncomfortable walking barefoot in the room.

Well after basically agreeing to disagree about the lack of transparency about their Pet Friendly policy, we also discussed what happened during our first night after having people above our room make noises that sounded like they were playing rugby. We called the front desk twice at 11pm and again after 12 midnight. They did go up to the room and told us that the family had kids that they were trying to get settled down. But nothing was offered from the front desk manager except to tell me that, ""they did their part"". Talk about a lack of empathy and concern for my family, the manager basically wiped her hands clean of this situation. 

So Residence Inn, a Marriott chain, does care about some of their customers but not all of them. In this situation, I was given the short end of the stick. So nothing offered to us until the very end, the manager said she would reduce our $100 Pet fee to $50. I told her I wasn't going to pay the $50 either.

For those not in the know, the restaurant enjoys showcasing jaguars, corvettes and lamborghini in the front to display their likings of high society tangibles.. then again, perhaps the owners of the vehicles don't want their cars parked next to grundgy , pollen covered tanks on wheels.. aka my car.  (Scroll to bottom for conclusion as middle is mostly rant)

Nonetheless, we arrived around 5pm (note that happy hour begins at 4pm and runs until 7pm.)  Few people occupied the bar seating area with the exception of a gaggle of grey haired business people sipping on cocktails and an older woman who had clearly been slinging back martinis like it was the end of the world.

The Mrs. and I sat down and calmly waited for a server...after about 10 min, I took matters into my own hand and strolled up to the bar and got a few drinks myself.  Shortly after returning, a slightly confused server hesistantly approached and offered us a menu and wanted to see if we needed a drink (mind you besides the ten people at the bar, there were roughly six other people in the bar area).

We received our drink and proceeded to order food.  A bit confused with the happy hour selections (more to come) we picked a few items covered under the happy hour (HH from here on) selections and a few not.  A busser/food runner brought a small basket of delicious tomato bread and some lightly brined, surprisingly sweet olives.

Our first items, tomato bruschetta and a mixed charcuterie plate arrived, both garnished with chunks of parmesan cheese and the same olives brought with the tomato bread... interesting.. but whatever.

We reread the cocktail menu and ordered a vodka drink and a gin drink.  Both were unfortunately not to our likings.. I think I compared one to a summer room air freshener and the other to a bathroom sanitizer, purely in flavor btw...

Around 630, the hostess informed us that our table had been reserved for 730 and I said not a problem as we were only waiting on some more items.  About 45..yes..FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER, (715) our sausage and white bean bruschetta and short rib arrived (these items had been ordered the same time as the first back around 545.  Our bewildered and somewhat slow waiter doddled around the room and finally made it to our table to see if we needed a drink... it was past 7pm and thus my cherry mood, and buzz had long gone.  I'm sure he is a nice person out of work, but I've seen sundials move faster than this guy, especially when liquor sales are the bread and butter AND a good portion of your tips... just saying..

Food: tomato bruschetta-disappointing hors d'oeuvre sized portions on dry bread
Charcuterie-somewhat acceptable, but needed something pickle related to cut through the saltiness of everything else... I mean.. garnishing with parm and olives is a bit of a salt overload
Sausage bruschetta- not bad although I doubt it needed over and hour to prepare
Short ribs - average and forgettable, needed a bit more sauce to make it pop

Our check finally arrived via carrier pigeon and I noticed that none of the drinks had been discounted.  On the bottom of the drink menu was clearly written,join us for happy hour, while on the food menu listed at the top said vodka cocktails, gin cocktails and certain wines would be half off.  Well, silly plebians that we were, when we ordered a gin COCKTAIL, off of the COCKTAIL menu, we thought it would have been included. NOPE.. the HH promo only pertains to items such as a vodka martini, gin and tonic, etc..I know.. ridiculous and terribly unclear.

That was ok, except for the fact that they then charged us for 3 drinks on the amended  ticket, while We got charged for 2 drinks on first ticket as there were only 2 of us eating. This is a very questionable business practice & as a result, I must truthfully say that because of this I am never going back.

And just like another reviewer has written, they changed my prescription in my glasses for no reason at all.  I have had the same prescription since I was 12 years old.  My husband actually took a pair of my glasses, went to Pearle Vision, and asked them to put my prescription in a pair of really cool frames he found for me.  It was a surprise (which is why he just took a pair of my glasses).  They gave him a hard time about it since he didn't have a script but finally did it.  The second time around when he went for the same thing, he took my glasses to them once again but this time, they put the wrong prescription in.  I noticed when he came home and I put them on and felt like Woah, these seem stronger.  But I figured maybe I just had to get used to how the frame was on my face.  Well, the third time, I actually went myself and they gave me a hard time about wanting to put my current prescription of my glasses in a pair of frames I brought with me.  They ended up making me get an eye exam (keep in mind, I've had two pairs done by them but this is the first time I've actually been examined there).  I give the eye doc my most recent pair of glasses my husband got my prescription in from them, and after the exam, he said ""Congratulations, your prescription hasn't changed"".  I'm like ""great, thanks"".  Well that was a different story when I got to the front desk.  The lady at the counter was like, ""See, your prescription changed"".  I'm like, ""The doctor said it hadn't"".  Long story short, I waited to speak with the doctor, and he's like ""Well, I just got the prescription off of the glasses you gave me"".

The takeaway from this story is that the second time my husband went, they put the wrong prescription in one of my lenses by 0.25.  This is why when I first put them on, I said ""Woah"", because they CHANGED my prescription.  I'm pissed because now my vision has been changed to what they put in my most recent pair of glasses.  They did all this to prove a point with pushing eye exams, so that if I ever showed up again, they'd have a new prescription documented on file and could say ""See there!  That's why you need an exam!""  Total scam.  If they would have just did what they were asked to do, which was put the prescription of my glasses into the frames I bought, everything would have been fine.  Their customer service sucks.  They also overcharged the hell out of me.  I decided to just pay for the eye exam and leave.  I don't trust them at all.  They just want to make money off of you.

I hate Pearle Vision.

Walked into the place just after it opened on Saturday.  Did not have a mask, but was willing to cover my face with my shirt.  Was harshly commanded by staff to ""leave now!""  When I said that I'd be sure to leave a good review, the clerk put it on me, telling me that I was ""breaking the law"" by standing in the shop without a mask (which is untrue -- no such law has been passed for either businesses or individuals).  STILL, I offered to do a transaction by telling her what I wanted and having her bring it outside the front door to me.  But still she persisted to harshly turn me away.  (They have an online purchasing system, but I told her I needed the product in hand -- I was purchasing gourmet beer as a birthday present).  She was adamant to refuse to do business with me!
     These are definitely strange times when shops are turning away business in favor of enforcing what is in effect segregation -- in this case people who have masks versus those who do not.  Even stranger was the fact that when I purchased over $70 worth of beer from BeerLOVE a few days earlier (the night Ida hit town), they offered masks at the door if you didn't have one!  Today, however, they offered no masks, only an uncompromising ""stay away!"" attitude for those of us without a mask.  Very confusing.
     Apparently, BeerLOVE has no clear operating policy, has not trained staff on the difference between law and policy (mask mandates apply only to the business itself, not the customer, which is why businesses offer masks to potential customers), has failed to adequately train staff on courteous customer service skills, and cares more about rigid policy enforcement than wanting to work on site with potential customers of any class.
     It's a shame because I was really pleased with their product, which is why I returned to repeat business.  I'm also in favor of supporting local shops.  But if you want to act in ways even the conglomerates are not, then you've lost a customer.",2021-09-05 12:47:52

After being served our food the waiter didn't come back around for more drinks until like 15 mins after. All the chef with facial hair and hair in general don't wear anything to cover their faces.

They came right away and did the job of clearing our kitchen branch sewer line of a grease clog far better using the auger and inspection camera to confirm condition as opposed to just pushing some grease around with the inspection camera like BHS did. They also bothered to find and use the clean out  on the side of the house like they are supposed to whereas BHS went straight to the roof. FYI companies charge more to go work on the roof so if they go to the roof first they are overcharging you. And Iron Men Plumbing charged me $185 for the work. That is exactly what I told BHS was the actual going rate for these services and they told me I was wrong. See the original review and company response. BHS charged me over $300 for the exact same job.

I arrived there before my friend and went upstairs to the Bigger Bar. I got a table, quickly ascertained that there was no table service, and walked over to the bar to place my order. I was going to have a draft and a burger. 

They had a fine selection of draft beers, and I decided I would have Chimay (on tap! WOOT!) and the burger. 

About 12 minutes went by and I was still waiting. Now I decided I no longer had time for the burger as my friend was due to arrive and I was beginning to wonder if I was even going to have the beer. The bar was not that busy. It really wasn't. I have worked in food service before and, believe I me, I have seen busy. This was - steady. At best. Basically the bartender was taking his sweet old time talking about only God knows what with a darts team. I get it; they were regulars. Whatever. I still wanted a beer. I tried getting his attention twice and was summarily ignored. 

Eventually (I would say about a 15 minute total wait) the bar-back took my order and I handed him my card. That was that. 

My friend showed up and she got her drink, also from the bar back. 

A little while later we decided we has better get going to our next destination. I went over to the bar to settle up and saw that there was a Chimay and a Michelob Ultra on the bill. WTF? I said ""Excuse me, but I only ordered the Chimay. I have no idea to whom the Mich Ultra belongs"". The bar back apologized and went to take care of it, when Chuckles the Dart Fan decided to get involved. He said there was a minimum and they just put that on there to make up the difference. 

I. Hate. These. Fucking. Minimums. They are illegal. Period. 

I said it would have been nice to have been informed and the bar back started to apologize again, I assured him it was not his fault. I said that since I expect a Chimay to be about 8 to 10 bucks, I was fine with a ten dollar total. I was not going to give them an extra 1.50 for as nonexistent beer. Dart Man mumbled something and I said ""I don't know what you just said, but that is what's happening here."" 

So I gave the bar back a couple of bucks as he was the only one who seemed even remotely interested in waiting on non-regulars. 

The two stars are basically for the poor bar back trying hard and the excellent draft selection (Boddingtons, Hoogaarden, Chimay, to name three). 

Chuckles the Dart Fan can kiss my round ass. 

_____________________________________________________ 
UPDATE: 
My bank statement came in the mail and I was not charged the 10.00 I agreed to pay but the whole 11.50. While it was only 1.50 it was annoying, so I called Dark Horse and spoke to a competent manager by the name of Sandy. 

She assured me that not only would the full amount of the second beer be credited to my account, but that I am welcome to stop in again for a Chimay on the house. She even went so far as to say that when I agreed to pay 10 without being informed of the minimum, I was being generous. 

Apparently, Chuckles the Dart Fan is no longer tending bar at Dark Horse, and my anecdote was additional proof to Sandy that they made the right decision in letting him go. 

Well, how about that? I think I WILL go and get a beer there.",2010-12-26 05:52:03

I had such high hopes for this place... Heard about the great drinks and the OhSoSkilled mixologists. I've traveled the country looking for the finest concoctions of Liquored Bliss (try Manifesto in KC) while entertaining clients and friends, alike. So, on this lovely evening of 6/10/2015 (a Wednesday night), I took my Nashville client and colleagues (and the expense account) out for a walk to this revered place after a nice client dinner. We walk up the steps... No one in line. No one waiting. No one at the hosting podium.  So, my 3 out-of-town colleagues (dying to drop a few hundred US dollars for some nice atmosphere) just parted the velvet curtains and walked into the bar to order a drink. Whoa. Apparently, I violated the daughter of Aphrodite herself by daring to order a drink at the bar. Suddenly, out of nowhere, there appeared an elfish hipster boy in skinny jeans who tussled his/her frosted two tone hair and informed us: ""You're not allowed to order from the bar. I have to seat you."" In disbelief, I stared at the four empty bar chairs in front of me and asked if it was ok to just sit here, in THESE empty four bar chairs (at a half empty bar) because there were four of us that wanted to sit at the bar. Apparently, that question angered Zeus himself.  Again, out of nowhere, a new, dark, menacing figure appeared: The HipsterGhostHost. He frowned and, with the greatest disdain, looked down upon us and proclaimed: ""I was eating dinner. I'll seat you, now"" as he ushered all of us back out, through the restaurant, in front of 40 people (watching us violate the Titans and Gods by daring to enter a bar and asking for a drink). So, Mr. HipsterFacialHairwithaVest (who is still clearly upset that we interrupted his dinner by daring to walk into this finer than fine establishment) herded us (like the obvious cattle that we were) to the previously unattended host podium (where, again, there was previously no one), turns and points to a corner booth and says ""You guys can sit in this booth in the corner"" ... So, I respond, with a polite grin, and ask: ""Sir, are you literally putting us into the corner for daring to order a drink from the bar?"". He just stares at me. He clearly found my Middle-agedMidwest self offensive for having aged and daring to not find mustache wax exciting. So, I try again and ask kindly if we can sit at the bar and he says ""No, you can't sit at the bar. We aren't THAT kind of bar, but you can sit in this corner booth, but not at the (half empty) bar."" So, I ask... ""You know, I've only been going to bars for twenty years, but I've never been to a bar that doesn't let people sit at the bar who want to sit at the bar... Is there a test or something I can take to earn a certification to sit at those empty seats at the bar? (I was feeling rather confident in my test taking skills at that moment, obviously - and not just because I have a Masters Degree from a fully accredited United States of America University - Rock Chalk Jayhawks!) So, Mr. HungryHungryHipsterHost replies ""I'm really sorry but we have to project a certain image and your group (of professional twentysomething and thirtysomething software developers  from across the country - and our client from Nashville) doesn't fit in at the bar."" Ouch. That hurt. Wasn't expecting that kind of Reverse Elitism in Nashville. So, I kindly informed him that, while he was of the highest quality of Douchebag that I'd ever encountered in all of my travels - and while I wished him and his hipster mustache and his recycled service industry vest the very best of luck - our group of yuppie professionals would not submit to the whims of a misguided, hungry, hipster host. No! We would not sit in the corner at his discretion because we were not wearing skinny jeans! No! We would revolt against that hipster machine of his creation and, instead, we would take our business (and desire and willingness to order lots and lots of overpriced exotic drinks) elsewhere - where it was appreciated (and where they wouldn't cram 4 of us grown men into a hidden corner booth- and where the host could clearly recognize a pair of Baldwin denim). 

Moral of the Story: Money walks when the Douchebag Host talks.

Hopefully none of this comes off as arrogant or condescending. I guess this part may sound a big egotistical, but as someone who is a chef by trade and am also an instructor, I feel like I have to be harsh on this to help the owners of this establishment work through their flaws and reinforce their techniques to better themselves throughout their time. 

Okay so, I live literally seconds from this place and placed my order on the app. I don't really see a problem with this as it is sort of the way of the future as well as this is their concept so, I fully understand it. Plus, it takes me 30 sexonds to get to the establishment door. I was here yesterday for a few burgers that I shared amongst my partner and my roommate. We had the regular smash burger, the special avocado burger and also the specialty fries with the pickles and condiments as well as some seasoned fries. Well, I figured I would be waiting for a bit as I waited 5 minutes to walk over to the establishment. I of course figured I would be waiting a bit longer as well seeing as these guy's are not magicians and do not expect them to have food ready in such short time. (People tend to forget that a great establishment makes your burger as it is ordered and isn't a fast food chain which holds it under heat lamps for over an hour.) Well, I wait about another 10 minutes for my food. Yes. The workers and I'm sure owners of the establishment were very nice, had a great smile on their faces and were very helpful. So, kudos for that part. I finally receive my order and get home within a few seconds, literally....I take out my burger and that of my roommate and partner. We take them out and low and behold they are luke warm at best. The seasoned fries are soggy and semi cold. Nothing was seasoned in terms of salt. Now, I'm okay with seasoned fries just being fries that are tossed in a spice when cooked but, it seems as if they just added the fries into the box and seasoned the top layer of the cold, soggy fries. The buns on the burgers seemed quite old, and was a bit hard and dry. Seeing as this establishment is merely days old, I couldn't come to realize why this was such. I get that a kaiser roll can be a big more dry, but this was almost stale by comparison. I understand they probably practiced cooking their menu products at least for a few days before soft opening, but I wouldn't think their batch of buns would be at such state so quickly. The hamburger patties were what they were, cooked decently, but very bland. They may have added a minimal amount of salt and pepper but it was not very noticeable. I think at the end of the day, I think was mostly disappointed with the fact that I waited about 10 minutes to eat food that was rather Luke warm at best. Now, I will give this place a shot again once they have established themselves a bit better. Usually this take about a month or so to do. But, hopefully they don't turn away hungry customers whom have heard of this place online through YouTube, Facebook, etc.... by constantly selling food that is mediocre at best. 

I will not speak of price points as it is within the average market of what places like these tend to be. And well, we are in a wealthier side of town, so I would suspect no one has any actual issues paying the price point. (Nearly 40 dollars for 3 burgers and 3 fries is a bit steep though) okay. I lied. I spoke of it a little. But, I promise don't change the prices. Just become better quality. 

What they have done with the establishment is very nice and quaint, so I think they did a great job of that. Hence 2 stars versus just one. But, at this point, I will stick to going to 5 guy's where I get a burger that is twice as good and a bit cheaper in the sense of quality. Again. I will be back for sure to give them a chance to get their feet more planted and established. But as for now, I will keep this at 2 stars. I hope the owners read this and can try to take corrective action to make their burgers what they make it out to be. 
 
My burger was the avocado specialty burger. This was a big miss. The avocado was fine but wasn't seasoned whatsoever and very sloppy on how it was placed. I basically paid an extra 2 dollars for what I could have paid 10 cents for. 

Last thing, maybe label the burgers a bit better. It was a little difficult to figure out which was which. For someone who has never been to one of these before. I don't know how your labeling and boxing works. So, it is best to mark them in some way.",2021-06-13 03:50:51

Simply not true, the brake pads needed replacing, but were not yet metal upon metal.  Unfortunately I was out of town and my wife paid them the additional $600+ to replace the brake pads and rotors.  I got my window fixed and new pads and rotors for almost $1400.  What I found particularly interesting of the 8 item list of things that needed to be fixed (to the tune of $3,000+) they failed to notice that I had my muffler suspended by a coat hangar.

Quijano-Vega, M.D, for which I had to wait a month to be seen.  On the day of my appointment I arrived 15 minutes early, as instructed, and provided a detailed health-history form that they had mailed to me.  I sat in the waiting room for an hour before being taken back to a room by a medical assistant who took a verbal health-history, vital signs, etc.  She then ushered me to another waiting room/hallway where I was instructed to wait for the doctor to call me back.  There I waited another 45 minutes - at this point it is a good hour and 45 minutes past my scheduled appointment time - before hearing my name called from another room.  (P.S.  I was there for a blood-sugar problem and you would think they could have advised me I would be there for such a long time and perhaps to bring a snack?! Ha!) 

Once I found the doctor's office, (I had to look around a bit for it as there was nobody to direct me to the correct room within this large practice), Dr. Quijano-Vega did not even acknowledge me, introduce herself or greet me in any way.  Throughout my entire appointment she hardly looked at me but just typed on her computer while firing off questions that she could have ascertained from the medical history I had already provided.  She did a very quick physical examination and that was it, didn't ask if I had any questions or offer any education on my diagnosis of a new medical condition.  Not only do I think this doctor was very rude in her interaction with me but I also did not appreciate how she acted very inconvenienced to have to answer my questions, even rolling her eyes and audibly scoffing at some of them.  Suffice it to say, I think this doctor is very unprofessional and I do not plan to return to her.

The one positive experience I had at this clinic was my interaction with the Dietician on staff, Norma Vargas-Suarez.  She was very approachable, kind and knowledgeable and provided me with some interesting insight, which is really saying a lot considering I am rather well-informed on the subject of diet/nutrition already.  

In summary, I do not recommend this practice due to the inconvenience of the exceptionally long waiting times I encountered, the unprofessional staff and the rude and at times, hostile Endocrinologist.

This may have been an outlying experience but we decided to get our orders to go as the bar did not have any space for us to sit down. Ordered the hangover noodles,duck buns and beef noodle soup with my girlfriend and we were both sorely disappointed. Though the duck buns were relatively good, the vegetable arrangement did no justice to the well seasoned duck. The pillowy bun was broken by the crunch of vegetables, breaking the experience that unfortunately broke the bank too. These buns mock the traditional snack food of Asia for the mighty price of $12 per pair with the lackluster arrangement. The hostess recommended the hangover noodles as I had sought something more substantial and what I found was superficial flavoring and roundabout spicing to hide the fact that the noodles were not cooked with adequate sauce. Again, the arrangement of vegetables was an interesting one to begin with, but the level at which they were cooked were not aligned with the dish at all. A traditionally soft paired noodles of the flat noodles, crunchy beans, crisp tomatoes and half-cooked mushrooms were used. There's no doubt in my mind that these vegetables were of excellent quality, but their preparations were elementary at best. Finally, the beef soup: I never though you could mess up beef soup until now. As I have stated earlier, we chose to get our meal to go in order to find seating, but what we found from the soup was something that would only occurred if we let it gestate for a couple of hours in the backseat of a car. This dish did not even have any facades of greatness, the broken noodles were housed in superficial soup with no real taste of stock and unfortunate use of sweet vegetables including spinach and lettuce that attempted from breaking away from tradition in a lackluster manner.

Sit down on our couch with all the other families and watch our big screen TVs because your going to be here all day. I was looking for a car to purchase something under 20,000 I had 7,000 to put down and didn't want my payments over 300 a month (my credit is good)  We found a salesman (can't remember his name but he said he had only been there for a month) Explained to him what I was looking for so we followed him down to a building. He pulled up a 2017 Nissan Maximum and said this car is 19,000. While I'm sitting there with him giving him my information this other couple walked out the door. This woman (I'm guessing it was a manager) asked the salesman man (not the guy that was working with us) "" where are they going?"" He replied they were just looking the woman got loud and said "" you don't let them leave without selling them something "" then she said ""come here"" the salesman walked over to her desk saying ""I tried I really tried"" she said ""that's the third person today you've let walk out of here without selling them something."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing and honestly I should have got up right then and left but I didn't. So the salesman brought the car up to the door so I could test drive it. I'm sitting in the car and the guy asks me ""did I leave a piece of paper in here"" I said no, the guy had lost the paperwork that he had just wrote all of my personal information on. So the car didn't really have any gas in it so he asked me to drive up to the gas station. I then noticed a chip in the windshield, he said he could have that fixed. Got back to the showroom and it was time to talk about money. After he went and talked to someone he came back with a breakdown. He said my payments would be 394 a month, I said no I don't want my payments over 300 a month. This whole time this salesman has been pushy and obviously not listening to what I was saying or didn't care one. He would just keep saying ""your getting a brand new car and free oil change, tire rotation and car detailed for the first 3yrs"". He said he would try to get my payments to 300 a month he went away and came back and said 323 a month. Once again I said no I don't want my payments over 300 he made a smart ass sound and said "" I'll pay the 23 dollars for the first 3months"". By this time I'm just tired of dealing with him and tired of being there (I was there for about 3hrs) so I said fine he said I would be next in the business office and I would be out of there in the next 30-45 mins. I asked if the windshield was going to be taken care of and he said he forgot to say anything about it but he had a friend in cookville that he would get to fix it. So we finally make it into the business office and Jorge is putting my information in the computer and he says ok your payments are going to be 394 a month I said no that wasn't the deal (my salesman never even gave him the paperwork where my payments would be 323) Then I noticed that the breakdown that we had talked about out in the show room the total after taxes and everything total was 22,000 (on my salesman paperwork). Now Jorge is printing all this paperwork off for me to sign (he doesn't explain to me what any of it it unless I ask him) The last page I was to sign was the breakdown of everything and he's total was 26,000 me putting 7,000 down and getting a loan for 19,000. NO,NO,NO I'm not getting a loan for 19,000 it's just not happening so I tore up the paperwork and walked out. This was the first time I had ever been in a big dealership business in my life and it was the worst experience that I have ever had!!!

Having said that, when my husband came home with our order we realized we were missing one of our small plates, Pane Ricotta and my daughter's meal, the Margherita pizza. He called and they did appropriately ask if he wanted them to just take those 2 items off the bill or remake the food, he opted to just pick up our missing items. 

When he arrived at the restaurant , the hostess went to get the manager and he basically said that whoever it was who he had to assume was the manager performed a play action pass with the food, said, ""Here ya go"" and just kept moving. No apology, no type of sincere response, NOTHING. 

First of all, we live in Blackwood my husband had to go all the way back to pick up this food without any consideration for that whatsoever. 

Second, no type of response except for ""HERE YA GO"". No attempt at customer service to someone who decided to come back to get their food. A ""thank you for coming back"" would have been nice or ""sorry for the mistake"" simply would have sufficed. We spent $86+ including tip on this meal and honestly if I knew that this would have been our first time experience with this establishment, I would have never tried this restaurant. 

I understand Covid has hit our restaurant industry pretty hard and places are trying their best to turn out excellent food even at the take out level but if any restaurant is using that as an excuse to deliver subpar service, then you will lose customers. Something as simple as good customer service really goes a long way and Cinder Bar, that was definitely a miss on your part tonight.

Margherita pizza was mostly salty sauce with a few teeny tiny leaves of basil ... so few, it should not even be listed as an ingredient. The ""amazing"" tres leches tiramisu was neither amazing nor bearing any resemblance to tres leches. It was a very weak version of tiramisu which was basically a small mason jar of whipped cream and vanilla fingers at the bottom with barely even a hint of espresso.  At $8, this is on the high-pricey side for any dessert, for which we were expecting to wowed but were seriously underwhelmed. Anyone who thinks this so-called ""tres leches tiramisu"" is ""amazing"" must've never had real tiramisu nor authentic tres leches. The seating outside lacks ambiance, and having to go into the bar to order outdoor service was awkwardly inconvenient, not to mention the total lack of hospitality by the bartender who clearly did not want to be taking food orders.

Wait....did I just step into an Orwellian Time Machine? Were those swinging doors I entered actually a portal to the past?

For about 90 years Howard Johnson Restaurants were the standard bearer for friendly family places to eat. And it felt almost as if we had traveled back a few decades to one of those.

--Bright open dining areas (Shoney's - just like HoJo)
--Cheerful, friendly, wait staff ready to assist any way they can (our Shoney's server Charlie reminded me of congenial HoJo staff back in the day). I think his name tag even said ""Uncle Charlie.""
--An extensive menu of familiar offerings (meatloaf, fish, fried and stewed chicken, salads, burgers, breakfast almost anytime. Okay...the meatloaf was on the run-of-the-mill buffet this day.) 

Ah, the days of yore....uh, maybe not so much.

Since Shoney's is less than 2 miles from BNA, we chose this Shoney's so we could meet with some old friends flying in from Arizona (who were then driving on to Eastern Tennessee.) The proximity to the airport and the fact that it's only about a half mile to I-40 made this seem an ideal spot for our rendezvous.

What was not ideal was the almost deafening mishmash of music blaring from the overhead speakers scattered throughout the restaurant. Since our friends are older and rather soft-spoken, it was difficult to understand what they were saying much of the time. And while we did ask to have the music turned down, we were told that that was impossible. (Aside: What? There's no volume control on this modern marvel of musical mayhem?) To our server's credit, he did find a spot in a corner where the speaker was either missing or turned off. So the music was not quite as loud...but bothersome nonetheless. And for the record, Charlie was the brightest spot in our visit.

The food: Our friends shared a marvelous, large turkey club sandwich that was so thick, they had to literally pull the huge quarters of it apart to eat. Big portion - good bargain. My wife had grilled salmon that had a sticky, albeit flavorful sauce. But that almost hid the fact that the salmon was on the edge of underdone; not rare - poorly cooked. Flavor - ok, but unusually wet and mushy, an odd character for grilled salmon.

I, testing the limits of my tolerance, chose the buffet. Food looked good. But, alas! As we all know, a buffet is a repository for food that might be fresh to start but, after it sits, loses much of its inherent character and quality. I knew that from the start, but still wanted to taste a variety of dishes. (A real throwback moment.) Meatloaf, a staple for diners and restaurants and buffets - sigh....no urge to return for seconds this time. And, everything else on the large serving stations - too salty and meh, too flavorless. Chicken - fried but with an overabundance of breading. Fish - what appeared to be Tilapia - ok, but still swimming (in sauce, figuratively that is). Potatoes, both mashed and roasted were pretty good. So, you can get your ""fill"" if you're duly hungry. And the food does not sit excessively long - they refill or replenish fairly frequently.  Bottom line - I'd recommend ordering from the menu.

So, while the age old iconic orange roof is missing (after all this is not a HoJo), there is a ""vibe"" still present (if you can feel it over the obnoxiously loud and eclectic mishmash of music genres we encountered). And if you want a relatively quick sit down, spacious place to meet with friends...this will still fit the bill at a reasonable price.",2018-08-06 03:38:06

We were quickly able to find seats and were greeted and served in a timely manner. Our bartender was well informed and willing to share his opinions. An ideal scenario. 

However, beyond the service CTT leaves things to be desired. If you are interested in beer, this may not be your stop. Unless your prefer the likes of bud light, Miller lite on tap. Don't get me wrong, there are more options. Though, with a bar this size, the beer list should be dominated by LOCAL craft beers. Reserving bottles for the everyday stuff that can be purchased at Wegmans. I did the solo west coast ipa on the list (by Victory) and was plenty happy with it. 

Like much of the other reviewers, I was disappointed by the price and quantity of food. $3 for a very small, mildly accompanied taco is a shame. My compatriots found some of the meats to be dry, mildly flavored or tough. The tortilla soup was passable, even though staff said it might be the best thing on the menu. Scary! That's a shame when the main reason to come to a taco joint is to get a taco that's rampant with flavor-packed meat. I chose the ceviche. It was fresh. Citrusy. Although too citrusy. All I could taste was the lime. It blunted the fatty goodness of the avocado and Mahi mahi. My tastebuds weren't tainted by illness so I can't blame that for the mishap. It was just passable. Nothing that was really memorable for me. 

Our tab for 4 was about $80. Be it a wonderful atmosphere, I still can't justify the cost when leaving hungry. If you're coming for tequila, you've made a good choice. If you're coming for solid Mexican, I think you may be leaving mildly satisfied by Tex mex and good service. 


Will I go back for food? Probably not. I'm more compelled to give the bar another shot. Hopefully, CTT expands their beer selection for those of us that enjoy craft beer on draft. Cans are great, but I reserve those for home use.",2019-01-14 21:48:32

The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because my expectations of chain restaurants are already so incredibly low. 

Was here tonight, my dad wanted to go for his birthday. It took over a half hour for the soup my mom and I ordered to come out and over an hour for our main courses to come out. It's mediocre chain restaurant steak, yet it somehow took over an hour to produce. My moms soup had a film layer on the top and the bowl/plate were blazing hot, which obviously means it was sitting under the warmer for a solid amount of time. When the main courses finally come out, parts of my steak were over cooked and dried out and the plates were blazing hot again, leading to my steak and my moms shrimp being dried out in some areas. 

It's a chain restaurant, I don't expect a 5 start Michelin meal.... but to wait over an hour for an over cooked rib eye is mildly infuriating.

I told him to open the glove box and he will find it under the netting. Thirty minutes later the advisor comes in to tell me everything is done and my car is ready to go. Cool, so I go to leave and check my glove box and sure enough my lug nut lock is not where the tech couldn't find it. The advisor runs back and gets me the lug nut lock, awesome, I leave. For me, checking things is always necessary so I did when I got home. I find that the air intake clip was half ass put on and I could visibly see a part of my air filter. I also wiped up some spilt oil that was on the plastic cover. 

Here's the deal. You would think the motivation in offering a free service is to do it exceptionally so the client will later spend more money with your business when their vehicle needs serviced. Unfortunately, this was not my case. I suggest to anyone that if you have the mechanical knowledge to fix your vehicle, or even just do the minor tune up items, to do so yourself or at least find an honest mechanic who values working on your vehicle as if it were their own. I won't be coming back to Parks Ford unless a warranty item would need fixed, which then I would hope is done with effort.",2019-04-20 20:33:36

their KIMCHI has HAIR in them. I actually found multiple jars with tiny black hair 
floating around. If you purchased it from this store, you better check.

their Ramen was expired so I had to put it down, and actually found out that entire
ramen in that row were expired. I was super disgusted

I actually tried to understand, but I finally exploded at the fact that one of the
sauce I purchased from this store today has EXPIRED SAUCE. Its expiration
date was freaking July 9th and I know that kind of sauce usually stays good for
more than months. I wonder how OLD THAT STUPID SAUCE IS?

Please, I don't think this is just a matter of luck to figure out
three disgusting facts about this place's product in just one day.

If you had bought food from this place, please check the expiration date
over and over just to make sure. you might be eating (drinking) something 
that wasn't worth buying.

kind of junks you are selling. I'm so disappointed with what I saw today.

Its pieces are generally military-inspired, with industrial accents and a dash of urban or formal style, dependent upon the piece and season.  The highlights are definitely the jackets, which are quite sturdily constructed and at a fairly reasonable price point compared to other designer brands.  They are also popular for their denim, as indicated by the eponymous ""Raw"" in the name, although they actually don't carry very many raw (untreated and not pre-distressed) denim.  The denim is slightly overpriced given the quality of the fabric, but like everything else here, has a fairly unique aesthetic.

The price points across their styles make little sense, however.  There's no intuitive sense to their pricing; sweaters are sometimes more expensive than a good jacket, a basic shirt might be three times more expensive than a similar one sitting next to it.  Supposedly, the difference lies in fabrics and construction, but it feels much more as if they are being sold at the price at which the company can make the most profit.  Perhaps this is a rather pessimistic view, though.

The main issue with the G-Star store is that you can find their clothes at other retailers for the same price or less.  Third party stores are generally more generous with their sales as well, which this store definitely is not.  The staff here are also merely average and talk to each other too much.  The store isn't merchandised very well; clothes are often arranged sloppily or stuffed a few too many onto a hanging bar, cheapening the overall feel.  If you want to buy G-Star, it is a bit ironic, then, that there are better places to do it than the official G-Star store.",2012-04-30 02:34:23

The service was ok. At times, it was just a tad bit slow for a relatively empty restaurant, but overall good service. Our server tried to memorize our order and didn't write anything down, and some of the side dishes came out wrong. 

My wife was eager to try the dry-rub ribs, as she is not really a fan of meat soaked in BBQ sauce. To be covered in a blend of spices, we both agreed her ribs lacked flavor. I went with the wet ribs, and I have to say it really didn't get much better. In addition to our ribs lacking flavor, my ribs seem to have a layer of fat gristle under between the skin and the interior meat. 

In regards to the side dishes the potato salad was not good. It tasted as if it was made with Miracle Whip. The collard greens were ok. The sweet potato was pretty good and the cinnamon butter was a great compliment. Surprisingly the friend Okra was pretty good. I guess you really can't mess up anything deep fried. 

I was not a fan of the wings. We ordered 10 wings with the mojo sauce. For starters the wings seemed to be undercooked to my liking and tasted a little weird. I told myself that if I ordered my wings hot, the way the should be ordered, that I probably would have enjoyed them, but I couldn't get pass the fact that the wings still tasted as if they were not fresh. 

Against my better judgment I decided to order desert. I decided to go with the banana pudding to go, as my wife was not willing to sit in that restaurant any longer. Usually desert can help save a meal, but not in this case. I am used to eating my banana pudding warm. What I received from the Red Hot & Blue was stone cold, and covered in a ton of whipped cream.

I don't mind getting messy for good food but just because something requires a lot of napkins doesn't mean it tastes good. There's really nothing worse than putting in a lot of effort for food that's only somewhat decent. 

I had the Reuben and am generally a big fan of the sandwich that is fairly simple but, in my opinion, very distinct. A good Reuben is defined by good sauerkraut. This one had very little and what was there was clearly pre-made, bland stuff. It was soaked in Thousand Island, which in no way makes it ""good"". Simple sandwich, simple ingredients. I never understand places that put it on the menu when they have no intention of putting a little effort into something so simple and classic. Do it well or not at all. 

My husband said the burger tasted like it had been unseasoned. Very bland. He also thought it was a little cheap, as the meat was pretty tough. He took the buns off because they contributed nothing to the sandwich. Bummer. 

I got a chocolate shake so thick I had to eat it with a spoon. If I had wanted to do that, I would have ordered a scoop of ice cream instead of a shake. 

They also messed up our order, so we had additional chips and fries. We gave them to the guys at the table next to us; which was the only perk of the visit, I didn't have to feel guilty about throwing away food.",2014-06-07 17:57:56

What was described as a Maryland Crab Cake was actually a crab salad flashed under the broiler. a warm mushy mess that I was told was served that way by design as its 99 percent crab meat. Please see photo. I had a Kobe burger with bacon. The bacon had the slimy piece of uncooked bacon fat at the end. Yum. Like that little piece of fat in the can of baked beans. My french fries were not crispy or brown and they only had honey mustard. Who has burgers on a menu and not even regular mustard? The seasonal vegetables that came with the wife's trout was couscous...last I checked a pasta. It was served luke warm and still had the shape of the pan it was cooked in.

Tables that arrived after us got their food, dessert and paid their bill before we received our entree. We asked our server more than once about the wait on our food and he would respond with a mere ""sorry not sure"". 

After about 1.5hrs of our wait we said this is getting ridiculous and the server responded ""I know I've been fighting in the kitchen for you guys"" which is a really awkward and weird response. What does that mean? Did they lose our order? Why is this an issue of ""fighting for us""? This made us feel very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if this was another issue with prejudices or judging us but we were treated differently than other table. After we finally received our order the food was cold and tasteless. Not worth $50-60 a plate. We alerted our server to the cold food and he did not comp all the cold disappointing food. 

To end the meal the server offered the birthday girl a comped dessert however when we received the bill the dessert was not comped. We alerted the server yet again and we given a shallow luke warm apology.

I'll preface this by saying I've never been arrested and have only ever really been a call for service; what a disappointment they've been. I'll further preface this by adding I have ties to law enforcement, so I wouldn't normally want to speak poorly of an agency but something has to give with Reno's (finest ).

I've lived in Reno for thirteen years and have unfortunately had more than one experience with them. Each encounter has been completely lackluster and begrudgingly answered if at all. I've experienced completely unanswered calls and more often than not slow response. A bit of advice here: if you want a faster response make it a medical call; maybe they respond faster because they think there won't be any actual work for them, but they do arrive more quickly. 

On one more recent occasion I had called to make a complaint against a relative, arguably a difficult call to make, but really needed to send a message. Knowing as I do this was a legitimate criminal act I made the call; what I got and not for the first time was an officer downplaying the incident, essentially wanting to get out of doing his job. Fortunately his partner arrived and was willing to scrub out the few hours work required to complete this minor task (again this wasn't the first time I've experienced RPD wishing for anything to do besides their actual job). 

On another occasion, I was simply treated poorly based on the bias of the officer working and their unwillingness (or they'd forgotten) to be an unbiased fact finder. Remember officers/detectives you must listen to all sides of the story and then you may look at all the facts to make a conclusion; do not bring your prejudices to the scene. 

I know law enforcement is hard work dealing with difficult people most of the time, but RPD is still a service industry, not a try to get out of doing your job industry. Suck it up princess, pull on your boots, and when you get a call to do work, go do work (and DO IT professionally).",2015-11-08 20:28:12

2nxCVtD_2FNNRDJOZhKb9A,Iq01HVPaGAJYJXUaCq3Dyw,Pb2Gda3L6H3SRefymTtzAw,1.0,3,0,0,"I had been to Gigi's for a work-lunch a few years ago and had a great experience, so I was pumped when I received a gift for $80 to use towards dinner.  The voucher specified that had to be used in 1 meal, no drinks included, for a max of 2 people.  We took a look at the menu online, and even though I'm a vegetarian (thus I tend to be a cheap date), we thought we could make it happen.

We arrived on Friday night and stood awkwardly by the hostess stand for a few minutes while bartenders and waitresses all told us to sit tight, the hostess would be right with us.  About 10 minutes later, we were asked if we wanted to sit inside, or outside.  I said outside and instantly regretted it.  We were first seated in high-table in front of Colonial Penn... the corporate building next door.  I have a friend who works there... and it just felt awkward, so I asked if we could move to the deck.  I'd never been on the deck before, and therefore I was unaware that it was like sitting in a back ally/hallway, so finally we moved inside.  By this point, i was embarrassed, and my boyfriend was clearly ready to kill me.  I don't blame him.  I was being annoying.

We settled into a high-table inside.  OK... step 1 complete.

We opened our menus and instantly noticed that a solid 50% of the menu available online wasn't listed?  Reaching our $80 goal was going to be tough since the food being offered was a) cheaper, and b) not vegetarian friendly at all.  We ordered drinks and mentioned to our waitress of our predicament, and she basically told us 'good luck' and that we'd be able to accomplish our $ goal with 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a desert.  Close... but not quite.

The menu did make reference of 'vegetarian options available... just ask', so i did.  I was hoping to hear that the seasonal pasta dish, or the awesome appetizers i saw online were actually not a myth, but i was redirected back to the pizzas and told that's about all they got.  Well ok then... 

My boyfriend started of with the french onion soup, and i got the hummus and pita.  He said the soup was decent... not amazing, not awful.  I'd say the same for the hummus.  There was, however, lots of it.  I had to stop myself as i knew i was in for the long haul.  I took the rest to-go

My boyfriend got the Angus sliders next... and i was out of options aside from pizza... so i ate his french fries that came as a side.  That was a bit confusing... as i wouldn't think that 'tapas' would come with a side... but the fries were pretty good... so i didn't give it a second thought.  He said his sliders were decent... not awful, not amazing.  We took 2 of the 3 of them to-go.

Our waitress came back and we ordered our entrees.  I, of course, got the margarita pizza, and my boyfriend got some ahi tuna mixed veggie entree.  When it came out, we were blown away.  My pizza easily could have fed 3-4 people.  It was massive.  I think of a margarita pizza as lighter too... but this was oozing with cheese.  I love cheese, so I'm not complaining... but it was certainly unexpected.  Taste wise, it was comparable to pizza hut.  It had the greasy crust.  Again, I enjoy a good Pizza Hut pie from time to time... so it wasn't bad... but just not what I'd expect from a 'Mediterranean' restaurant in olde city.  I took the remaining 6 slices to go.  My boyfriend said that his tuna dish tasted like it was a 'steamer sensations' from healthy choice or something... yet it was $25!  One of the more expensive items on the menu.  He wasn't hungry enough to eat the whole thing... and it clearly wasn't worth finding extra space.  We didn't even bother asking for this one to go.

We needed to get desert to take us over the $80 mark, so we just got a cake to go.  Our first 2 drinks were supposed to be 1/2 price... so either beers are $8, or our waitress messed up the bill.  Regardless, we just wanted to get out of there... so we didn't even bother to correct it.  We owed about $30 for tax/tip/drinks... and we agreed that the $30 we spent on the meal wasn't worth it... let alone the $110 it should have been (without the voucher).  We walked to the car having pretty much grocery shopped for the week- hummus, 2 sliders, 6 slices of pizza and a piece of chocolate cake...  

The vibe at gigi's is that of a restaurant that isn't doing so hot.  The portion control is off, the prices are way too high for the quality of food being served, etc.  I must say our waitress was pleasant... and aside from not taking a single one of our plates such that we were stacking stuff to try to make room for more stuff... she was pleasant, attentive, and quick.  I hope this place gets it together...",2012-08-20 14:29:04

5tZEIq0h9xjWzaGmCwhKng,mI7R2QkPukwPIU0shWhOBQ,V8we7-uCa-SouadZmZ9Ieg,1.0,4,0,0,"Came here with my boyfriend last night as we were deciding between iHOP and the CF since we were both really hungry and just wanted filling food. 

The first thing I noticed was that when our waiter brought over our water there were lemon slices floating in it. I'm not a health freak but I always prefer my lemon wedges on the side of the glass because who knows if they even washed them? Anyway it was just a passing thought and I didn't think anything of it. 

I ordered the pasta carbonara and immediately I knew there was something wrong. The sauce tasted so bland, except where the waitress grated Parmesan cheese over. I added salt and pepper and there was barely any difference. Regardless, I finished about half of it before my boyfriend and I decided to take the rest of our food to go. 

I got home and I felt really sick all of a sudden. I went to bed early and when I got up for work the next morning I had an upset stomach. I called out from work and thank God that I did because a half hour later I threw up all the fluids I drank that morning. I threw up two more times afterwards and had an upset stomach two more times later in the day. 

I didn't associate this with anything until I called my boyfriend at work and he said it sounded like I had food poisoning. I read up on the symptoms of it and he was right. I was shaking, feeling feverish, and my hands and feet were tingling. I had lost so much fluids that every time I stood up I started seeing black and white and had to hold onto something. 

My boyfriend has been in the industry for more than 20 years, owned restaurants, been a partner, and been a general manager. He said that when sauces are left out too long, they lose their taste, and that was probably why I got so sick. He said he noticed me seasoning my dish with salt and was surprised as places like the Cheesecake Factory have dishes with high calorie counts and are already so flavorful to the point of being unhealthy. 

I called the restaurant and told Anthony the GM what I had experienced and he offered to give me a gift card. I said no thank you and would prefer a partial refund for at least my portion of the meal. He said that it was not possible. I even offered to bring in the food we had taken home for him to inspect but he said it was not necessary. 

Due to his lack of assistance, I called the guest services line in California and they were much more kind even though they still refused to offer a refund, though they did offer to look into the issue. They offered a gift card as well and I was thinking to myself, ""are these people serious? They think I want to get food poisoning again for free this time."" I said even if they can't offer me a refund I don't need a gift card as I would never return. 

Clearly TCF Is only interested in money and not winning their customers back or making sure their health inspection standards are on par. Thanks for nothing!!!!",2017-12-01 04:24:14

I admit that my expectations are high but if you have solid flavorful dish then you are good to go with me. 

My husband's family decided to all meet up for dinner at this restaurant. It has a nice atmosphere and the decor is simple and clean. I ordered the veal parm thinking that I would induldge in a dish that I don't get to have regularly. Themeat was super tough, not tender at all, the sauce was very ordinary and I had a plate filled with spaghetti I didn't even know what to do with. It was just blah. 

My husband had a creamy primavera dish that was also just okay. We smothered it in grated cheese and that made it a little better. I was not impressed at all.

Several years ago when they first came to be, and everyone and their mother didn't have an AMEX Platinum card, they were really awesome. Great food, plenty of space, quiet, luxurious appointments, massage rooms, premium drinks, etc. I used to look forward to visiting the lounge and would plan my frequent business travel in a way that allowed me to spend time there. It was a great place for me to jump on conference calls and relax in between flights at the airports.

The last few times I visited a Centurion lounge, I found myself irritated and pissed off. I was in Dallas pre-COVID and the lounge was so crowded, I couldn't find a place to sit. I had to leave and head over to the much larger Admiral's Club.

I landed in Philadelphia the other day and went over to the Centurion lounge for lunch... I was turned away and told that the lounge was only available now prior to your flight and in between flights, not after your last flight. I left and had lunch in the Admiral's Club.

I am a business traveler 95% of the time, but recently, I brought my wife and two children on a vacation to Denver. We stopped in at the Centurion Lounge and I was told that they now only allow two guests, including immediate family members, and I would have to pay FIFTY dollars for my 7 year old to come in. So, we left and went to the Admiral's Club where my entire family was welcomed free of charge.

On top of my specific circumstantial issues, the lounges are also militant in their application of COVID19 restrictions. After being packed like sardines in TSA and then on the plane, it sure does make a lot of sense to limit capacity in the club, reduce all of the food services, and maintain strict social distancing. I know... this is what everyone has to do these days, but its still yet another factor that significantly reduces the lounge's value to traveler's like me.

The Centurion Lounge is supposed to be one of the premiere ""benefits"" of the American Express Platinum card, which comes with a $550 annual fee. At one time, it was a premium benefit and was one of the primary reasons I kept the high dollar Platinum card. Minus the Centurion lounge, my Chase Sapphire (and other premium cards I don't have) has just as many (sometimes more) perks. Now that the Centurion lounge has lost it's allure, I am cancelling the card. The Admiral's club and other lounges are back to being better options.

BOTTOM LINE: The once prestigious American Express Centurion Lounge is now an over-crowded, generally unavailable and run-of-the-mill airport lounge that will nickel and dime you when you show up with your family. I'm out.",2021-02-24 16:07:56

On two separate occasions ""Roxy"" has been surly and out of line in her treatment of customers. The most recent was especially ridiculous and I will not go back. 
I was there for breakfast, ordered sliced tomatoes instead of hash browns. When the waitress brought my plate I realized that they had forgotten the tomato and gave me the hash browns. No big deal...the waitress kindly recognized the error and said she would bring the tomatoes. Next thing you know, she comes over to the table with an empty plate and, embarrassed, says we need to scrape the hash browns of the plate before they can swap the tomatoes. I couldn't believe it! I respectfully refused and asked our waitress to send over the manager. 
This manager was smug, arrogant and provided the WORST customer service I can remember. I explained how unprofessional, and insulting this was - the implication was that I was trying to cheat them out of a plate of sliced tomatoes! Her attitude never changed. She is not doing this establishment any favors!

Anyway, I know it might not seem like a big deal, but she is always really arrogant and unhelpful (we have gone there a lot since we live nearby.) In fact, other people in the diner expressed that they had experienced her arrogance before as well.

Unfortunately, this time wasn't much better. We were a small party of 2 people and our wait time was well over the time they had told us. They should have had a much better idea of the wait time and been honest about it because the difference in a 30 minute wait vs an hour wait would have caused us to go elsewhere. 

Next, when we were finally seated, we were seated at a table directly in front of the doors. They had 2 side by side doors that the servers kept running in and out of to serve people that decided to sit outside. While it wasn't a freezing cold day, it was quite cool out and we wanted to be inside where it was warm, instead we were constantly battling the cold air that was blowing in every time they would come in/out. The doors kept constantly slinging open and every time would come roughly a foot from our table. There were constantly people hovering and standing around us waiting to go in and out. Very annoying and uncomfortable to enjoy. We asked immediately if they had another table and they told us we would have to wait longer if we wanted one. Already annoyed by the long wait, we thought we would tough it out. Big mistake on our part.

The menu is all over the place. It appears to be very amateurish in preparation with random ingredients put together to make up dishes. Especially the specials, they look like they are ingredients about to go bad so they decided to throw those together and pretend it was something unique. I ordered the stuffed French toast and they brought me pancakes.

3. RAT infested

5. They towed my car from a legal parking spot for which I had a permit for due to construction they were doing on the property. Damaged the windshield of the car and refused to pay for it and gave me the run around. I have since replaced it myself. 
6. They did a renovation awhile ago and had us move out for about a month upon coming back there were holes in the wall. I put in request they shoddily repaired and now want to charge me. 
7. The management gives you the run around when complaints are made and lots of finger pointing.

All the lower front end cabinets had to be completely replaced due to the water damage to the PARTICLE BOARD the cabinets are constructed from. Also, speaking of cabinets-they were about an inch off square at installation, which obviously can only cause everything connected to them to be, ""off"". 

Right now we are deciding whether to return the coach under Florida Lemon Law or give it to Nexus for, however long they are asking to have them go over and repair the other issues (many). Honestly, we don't even feel like we bought a new coach at this point. 

We fully expected to be enjoying the Summer with it, and so far we haven't been able to. Hard to take a coach out when the slides, generator & stabilizers aren't working properly. We are very disappointed with the whole thing, especially Nexus. It is clear they took an excellent motor & transmission & then just slapped their crap on top of it.  

LAZYDAYS nor NEXUS have DONE ANYTHING TO REMEDY THE SITUATION, SO IT LOOKS LIKE NEXUS  SOLD US A LEMON. A Wraith is a Wraith, no matter who you buy it from.  Their customer service has been terrible & Lazydays has been almost as bad.  

If I posted everything we have gone through & ALL OUR PHOTOS, it would shock you, as to how bad this experience has been-all we did was buy a brand new, custom 2020 Nexus Wraith, and what we got was headaches & a big pain in the tush!  

We have been more than fair, more than reasonable- calls & emails go unreturned or not returned for days/week, haven't heard a word of follow-up from our salesperson, ""Shane"".  

They sold us this coach & couldn't get us off the lot fast enough!  They leave us no choice but to pursue remedy under Florida Lemon Law & interviewing attorneys, as it seems we are left without option.",2019-06-14 16:38:58

I have never in my life written a public review, but I feel compelled to after my experience here. Firstly, I have had many different massages at many different places and I can honestly say this was the worst and most uncomfortable massage experience of my entire life. Let me walk you through this: Firstly, I go in to get my massage and I tell the masseuse what I am wanting her to do (mainly focus on my back)... does she do that? No, she spends the entire time of the massage barely touching my back and telling me all these stretches and exercises I need to be doing to avoid tension in all the areas of my body. She is literally talking and rambling the entire time of my massage (and swearing).  Every time she would tell me anything she would take her hands off my body and talk with her hands for a good five minutes (each time).. I mean.. really? I didn't ask you to do that. I don't care that she can identify all the parts of my body that are stressed and tense - I desperately needed her to massage my back. I also don't care for all of her ramblings. I needed a massage for my back which bothers me every day and that's what I came in for. Not only was the massage horrible, it wasn't even relaxing - I could hear the music from the salon louder than the dinky little stereo playing the relaxing music. I was listening to 107.5 the river the entire time and listening to the people in the salon's conversations rather than being able to relax. The floor wasn't that clean - there was stuff everywhere. Such an unprofessional environment - I'm shocked they are still in business. I am so glad I didn't pay for a full massage here because I would have wasted so much money. I wish that she would have just done what I had asked her to do and kept her mouth shut the entire time. Afterwards, she made it a point to tell me that gratuity was separate from the groupon. After I handed her the groupon she said, ""Ok and now time for the gratuity."" Excuse me? That is so unprofessional. You don't ever ask anyone for gratuity. Vanity Salon, if you read this then you shouldn't take it personally. You should honestly do something to fix these problems and start handling things more professionally. If you don't focus on creating a professional and relaxing atmosphere then your massage department will honestly run you out of business. Customer service is what will drive you to the top and until you can figure out how to give your customers what they are wanting, you will never succeed.

HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH CHINESE?  

Looked like a nice place--nice decor---it all went downhill from there.

(Let me say:  I usually don't complain--I just deal with it--chalk it up as a bad experience to learn from and never return to the restaurant ever again...)

So here we go:
Against our better judgement, my family  chose Chinese over Italian.

The menu is ""a la carte"" ...which is usually fine--

We should have known what kind of experience it would be--beginning with the pot of tea--which was served LUKEWARM.  

I have never had a lukewarm pot of tea from any Chinese, Japanese, Thai Restaurant,  or even a N.J. Diner.  Usually the tea is so HOT that you must add ice to your cup.  

And, the waiter did not pour the first cup--as is customary--in any restaurant--should've been a red flag.

It didn't taste like Oolong Tea--not sure of the taste.

A complimentary bowl of what looked like marinated vegetables with pepper flakes was delivered with the 1st pot of tea.

(No kimchi or noodles--ok fine)

My daughter tried the marinated vegetables and said that it tasted like---spicy whole grain bread
Weird, huh?

Then, the egg rolls arrived--which appeared to be homemade.  The waiter handed my husband four butter knives--not passing them out to each of the four of us.  I cut my egg roll in half--proceeded to eat it--until all this liquid started dripping onto my plate.

My son asked me what was all the liquid running into my plate--GREASE.
Skip the egg rolls.  

I ate a couple of noodles out of the bowl--that we had to ask the waiter to bring.

Our dinners arrived--
My husband chose pork fried rice--my son chose Sesame Chicken with white rice--my daughter chose Walnut Chicken with white rice--and I chose General Tso's Chicken with white rice.  

The above-mentioned are very popular dishes we have ordered countless times from many places throughout the US.  

We asked for another pot of tea when the food was delivered.

The 2nd pot of tea was delivered and the waiter refilled our water.  Tea was Lukewarm--yet, again.

We should have said something to the waiter to tell him that the tea and food was barely lukewarm.  

However, he never returned to ask how the food was or if we needed anything--possibly extra napkins or refills on our drinks.

Everyone's food was barely lukewarm--served with LACK of FLAVOR:

 My daughter's chicken on her walnut chicken dish was not appealing.  My son said it looked like slugs--so she didn't eat it.  The only thing tasty on her dish were the celery and walnuts.  There were, also, gnats in her bowl of white rice--which started flying around our table.

My son's sesame chicken tasted strange--as did my General's chicken.  It appeared white--breast meat--was not APPEALING OR APPETIZING.

My husband's pork fried rice was served lukewarm, as well.

We were hungry, traveling through the Hamilton area--and live in Gloucester County.  When I got home I felt so lousy.  And spent most of my night running to the bathroom.

Food in restaurants should be served piping hot with steam rising.

I recommend that you stay away from this restaurant and I am contacting the Mercer County Board of Health--food is supposed to be served at a certain temperature,  and should not have gnats in it, etc.

On the Szechuan House website it boasts and pats itself on the back with this direct quote from their website:  

""Szechuan House is  among the top 100 Chinese restaurants in the United States.""
(which I did not read until I was home in the BATHROOM.)

How can they boast and say that about their restaurant--when it's a made up lie?  There are food carts out there that are far better--even a fast food Chinese restaurant at any given mall food court is better--maybe even served with less grease!

We have never had such a horrible experience--especially all of us at the same time.

Many questions came to mind--as I still feel lousy and lie awake tonight:

Are they operating on a low or shoestring budget?

Was this restaurant short staffed?  

Are they going out of business?  

Having trouble with or paying their food vendors or employees?

Was the chicken old or sitting on the counter ?  

Is the refrigeration system not working properly?

They are not following the N.J. State or County Board of Health Codes.

Disgusting Cuisine!!

Rides were designed for 2 or 3 loading stations but they only run 1 or 2, respectively, increasing the ride wait times.  This is most likely due to lack of maintenance dollars to keep all stations running and cannibalizing parts or just shear unwillingness to staff the ride appropriately.  Another potential is that they are trying to drive add-on business by selling more quick queues.  

Ride wait times are very inaccurate never on the good side.  Cedar Fair, Disney and Universal do this much better.  

I paid $200 for 2 quick queues and still struggled to have a great time not due to wait times obviously but mostly due to other reasons.  I am referencing wait times based on talks with people who did wait in line and asking them their wait experience.

Many rides are dated in a bad way.  Not in a nostalgic wooden roller coaster way.  There are 4 that we really liked: chakeira, Tigris, cheetah hunt and Mantu.  These however fail to compare to the mega coaster era but are fun.  

The worst part, you buy a cup that is refillable but the stations to refill them are far and few between.  And once you get there, you have to wait in a 15 minute line to pay $1.00 for your refill.  Here is a pro tip, automate the coke freestyle machines and put them out more frequently.

Locker rentals are $8 a day.  Ok, nickel and dime you but expected.  Food is terrible and expensive.  The pizza was the worst.  The BBQ is mediocre but extremely expensive.  $12 for a turkey leg is highway robbery.  

If the President of the company were to follow a day in the life of the average attendee, they would realize the folly of their business.  I will fly down and share the experience with the president, so that they can see how dismal it is at all their parks I visited: Busch Gardens, Sea World and Aquatica.  

Sea World was by far the worst experience, again even with quick queue.  The penguin ride was hotter than hades waiting in a tunnel of fake ice and no air movement.  At gardens, the cobras curse is a stroke away from a law suit.  No air movement, hotter inside than outside.  All to cut costs.  

Cut costs is all I saw at all three parks.  If that is the memory you want left in the mind of your visitors, well done... well done.",2019-07-18 20:33:09

By week two, we noticed that the lacquer on what was supposedly at least 100 years old started fading and actually staining its surroundings.  I would be sitting at the table and notice stains along my sleeve if I rested my arm on the table. 
We noticed that 'metal' tag underneath the table also started strangely peeling off (again, after 100 + years...).  

I tried not to think about it but it kept getting worse.  

One evening I was picking up my dry cleaning and the owner of the cleaners, who has known me since I was in the single digits, hands me a few blouses and my husbands shirts.  He had a strange look on his face.  I asked him if everything was ok.  

He then looked at me and asked, 'why do you use so much sharpie these days?'    

I was like 'pardon?'

He went on, 'your item have sharpie ink so much on sleeve on belly area. So much!' 

I realized that what we thought was 19th century lacquer was actually sharpie.  

I asked him how he knew it was sharpie/ modern ink.  He brought out a particular chemical from the back meant to remove marker and pen ink  from textiles and showed it to me.  He said, 'because this only work on ink like sharpie... water mixed cheap ink like sharpie.'

Needless to say, we took the table to a specialist a week later and he confirmed that it was a fake.  The finish was touched up with modern water soluble ink from a sharpielike pen and instead of 19th century ebonized iron finish,  someone had used bondo to fill in the millions of worm holes through the bottom,  and the label was applied after the cheap finish job that's why it was peeling off.  It also didn't make sense for date of fracture.  

The expert told me he had seen pieces from auction houses like this before.  Scammer auctioneers do this sort of thing supposedly.  They take tags off of some disaster item or fragment of a piece and put it on some less disastrous worthless piece that they fix up with whatever is on hand to make it presentable enough from a distance  and then sell it as a high dollar item, often to people online or even in person.  


I told the specialist that we had purchased the table for 3500 dollars.  He laughed and said something along the lines of 'that's some very expensive worm-feed.'

Let's start with the good.

Very cool décor.  There's graffiti art around the restaurant. A very cool vibe and I really like how the windows open in the front giving it that ""outdoor-indoor feel."" 

The margaritas are also very tasty. We got a flight and the pear one was delicious! The prices too are also very reasonable.

The Bad:
Not a fan of the food. The first time I went was before they even opened for a sneak peak.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I knew they were still troubleshooting some issues and still working out all the kinks.
 
Keep in mind, I'm a vegetarian and ordered George's Dirty Taco and the Mantis. I don't do well with spice but could barely eat the Dirty Taco because of the sauce. As for the Mantis, it wasn't much better- it had little to no flavor.

The Service: 
The first time around as I mentioned, I gave them a pass. It was the first night, servers were still training, and it was a full house.

This recent time though, it was just rough from start to finish.

It took our waitress SO long just to get our drinks, they messed up one of our orders, and then she spoke down to me in front of everyone telling me I filled out the ""scranton"" menu wrong and needed to redo it so the cooks could see what I wanted. 

When I did... she never returned,  so that everyone got their food and I was stuck waiting for mine. Once again, when my food finally did come, it was disappointing to say the least.

The only good thing- the manager Ashley, comped our meal after we explained everything that happened.

All in all, I expect customer service to be lacking in places like this, but I expect a decent job done.  Nail polish on the skin, poorly shaped nails, and uneven paint job?  I will not be back.",2012-04-14 23:17:28

Service is a totally different thing though. To start, they don't answer the phone. Ever. During this golden age of wireless communication nobody there can be bothered to carry a phone with them? When we told our in-laws we had gone to Five-Acres my father-in-law immediately told us he's never gone because he can't get anyone to pick up the phone. 

We adopted a cat from them but there were unusual things about how they handled it. I've never adopted a cat who wasn't already fixed before and had questions and concerns. They told us they would not hold him for us until his surgery came through even though we saw a couple of adopted cats with signs stating that they were waiting to go home with someone. So they were clearly holding some cats for somebody, but would not for us. They assured us that this cat was unlikely to spray or mark since he hadn't in the shelter - he should be fine until he could get in for surgery. Here's an idea I've seen used many other places: don't offer cats for adoption until after they're fixed. Regardless, we liked the cat and he was very friendly and easy in the shelter so we adopted him. 

Once we got our new guy home several problems arose. He immediately sprayed marking several spots - not the end of the world, but not great, and counter to what they told us about this cat. Secondly he is an unpredictable biter. I've had cats all my life and I know the difference between a playful warning, an over-stimulated nip, and an outright break-the-skin bite. This cat has been showing escalating aggression toward me and seems generally nervous anytime I move my hands. He also shows no trigger signs. He has all his claws (as he should) but what will happen when we need to trim them? Cat bites can come with serious health hazards. It's entirely possible this guy is just a bad fit. But this takes us back to point number one: they won't answer their phone to talk us through what our options are.

We finally got a call back after leaving a message and they told us to come in to talk to Nicky and she would talk us through some things we might try. We felt like maybe we were getting somewhere. They told my wife to meet them at 11:00 am. We showed up and spoke to two different people about our pre-arranged meeting with Nicky. Some volunteers arrived while we were waiting and got immediately seen while we continued to wait. Nicky finally spoke to my wife after we had stood there waiting for 25 minutes. The information shared was not more insightful than a quick google search returned. 

We're not people who quit on our animals although I'm reaching my limits and this experience has me thinking I will go elsewhere in the future. The nice facilities aside I've had way better experiences with Petsmart than this. 

Save yourself the hassle. Find somewhere where they care equally for the adopters as they do for the adoptees.

If there's a big party next time anticipate. And since it's Friday, expect to be busy. Other customers in the main dining also needs to be served. There are two other tables/customers who are also upset. 
You can't have them wait 30-45 minutes. They still have to order and wait for their food to be cooked and takes another 30 minutes. And if an item in your menu can't be served because it's late and it takes 45 minutes to cook, you should revise your menu. Or just close early and don't make customers wait.",2016-08-27 04:16:35

This place gives you a dive meets diner vibe, set to be a creole Louisiana atmosphere.

The service here is hit or miss for me at this point. My first time dinning here I had to wait several minutes before I was greeted by the server at the bar. I was dinning on a Sunday because I was told that had drink and burger specials, and I never pass up the opportunity of a good burger!!! The service this day was very slow for a not so busy evening. Food and drinks seemed like it took an hour to come out. Good thing I wasn't that hungry!

The burger I ordered was suppose to be on special for $6 but since I ordered it w/ mayo, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bacon which never made it on the burger, my total for the burger was $10. Trust me this burger was not worth Hamilton I paid for it.

My second dinning experience I tried their ""crayfish bisque soup""--- never having crayfish before, I was a bit skeptical. But, it was actually very tasteful. Very smooth consistency with a nice  kick of spice. I also tried the ""Captn' Crunch chicken fingers w/ vanilla dipping sauce"" these we're also good.

Overall my experience here is not good or bad, but rather in between. This place is a friends' favorite so I'm sure I will be returning.",2016-03-12 15:13:14

Needless to say I had to pay the $75.00, so they didn't impound my car. Overall, the driver should have collected or communicated that on site.

She basically told me that it was my fault that my skin still looked so terrible and I obviously wasn't trying hard enough. I left in tears and cancelled my next appointment.

Some people can't afford to pay for Wi-Fi or air-conditioning for their own apartment. That is why cafés exist. 

Unfortunately, Green Line Café is just another pretentious place that doesn't serve good coffee, have air conditioning or even a dedicated Wi-Fi. For some reason, hipsters love to sweat. Hipsters rule this part of town, so finding a café dedicated for working stiffs is near impossible.

Only reason why Green Line Café doesn't have Wi-Fi is because they don't want to spend the money. They don't want to spend money on air conditioning either because they are cheap. They like to tell you that you don't need Wi-Fi to enjoy yourself, however that is not the case for a lot of people. Most of the people living in that area are college students and young workers. We need Wi-Fi! I don't care about Facebook. I don't want to go to a café just to check on my Facebook or Twitter status.

Gross. Then we ordered appetizers and mine had a 12"" black hair buried in it. I can't make this up.

I have never ever had to add salt to Chinese food! The fried rice was disgusting. It was dark brown, greasy, bland and unappetizing. Again with the salt and soy sauce! There were no peas or egg in it. I had expected a much lighter looking rice with bright veggies in it. The won ton had just a little tiny bit of filling in it and the egg roll was mostly cabbage. The egg rolls at Jack in the Box are much better! My mother and I think that they were too lazy to make a fresh new plate and instead got the food from the buffet. The food was not hot and steamy when we got it. It was just warmed as if it had been sitting around. My mom's tea was not hot at all. No one came to check on us until they presented us with the bill. I told the owner/manager that I did not like the food and I wasn't going to pay for mine. I had barely eaten anything. Not even all of the egg roll. She was mad at me.

However, after 14 days of beating my head against a brick wall, I am going public. ""An experience like no other"" is what this dealership advertises, and that is true. I have purchased probably 20 cars throughout my life, and this experience was by far the worst. We live in Chicago, and we purchased an LX through this dealership. Here is a sampling of what we experienced:
1) Telling me about a mandatory ""safety feature"" $379 charge AFTER the deal was done. Being many hours away, I specifically asked on the phone, ""Tell me the final bottom line price of what we would pay for this car, including any paperwork fees, taxes, etc."" I had this conversation with two different people. They gave me a bottom line number and only said that the specific taxes might be different out of state. I understood that. However, when we got to the final paperwork, there was a new $379 safety charge. ??? The salesperson said that this charge was added to all vehicles going out of their lot, and gosh, so sorry he hadn't told me. I said that it was too late to tell me about a charge at this point, and he said he would escalate to a manager. Hours went by.  Hours.  I had to raise a stink with the salesguy to get a mgr to call me back. Finally, Tina got on the phone and said she would waive part of that fee (for rear blinking lights) because the car was originally sold through them, and the original owner had paid it. I am still not sure why the theft registration was not also done originally and why I had to pay that, too, but oh well... onto getting the car. 
2) My husband was already on his way on a bus to go pick up the car, and I had offered to pay for the car before he left, as I was sure they didn't hold cars. My salesperson said that he would look into how to do this remotely, and I said, ""OK, but my husband is leaving Chicago to come get this car."" However, when I talked with the manager, there was no hold on the car. Someone could have bought it before my husband's 5-hour trip!  
3) We specifically asked if the back seat remote was there, and we were assured that all parts were there. When my husband picked up the car, however, there was no remote. What a surprise at this point. There also was not a wheel lock thing. My husband had it written into our contract that these would be shipped to us ""tomorrow."" It is now 13 days after ""tomorrow,"" and still NO REMOTE or wheel lock!! I am resorting to posting to Yelp to get some attention on this. I have turned into a pesky caller to our original salesperson, who personally assured me that his service department was going to order this remote and that he would personally oversee that it got FedEx'd yesterday... no call, no FedEx, no remote. I am not going to give up, which is what I think they are thinking I will do. 
4) Paperwork. What a nightmare. I get that it is more difficult to do an out-of-state transaction. Of course. I am not unreasonable. However, if you are going to want to sell out of state, you need to have your ducks in a row, or you need to stay on top of things more. We bought the car on a Friday. My husband brought back the paperwork for me to counter-sign, which I did. I sent it back Saturday. Days passed. No return envelope. More calls. More promises that it would be sent tomorrow. No envelope. More calls. Finally, more than a week after the paperwork was returned to them, I got mad, and that is what it took for our salesperson to ""go the extra mile for me"" and ""personally oversee that I got my paperwork,"" which he did do. But then.... onto this kicker...
5) The paperwork for the title was not entered until all of this happened! Seriously. The application for the title went in way more than a week after the sale happened, and I think it only happened because I raised such a stink about our paperwork. 
6) Hand-offs galore. This is a Dilbert cartoon operation in action. Whatever process Lexus is touting about this type of dealership being better should experience what I have. There is a web guy, a sales guy, a manager who is too busy or on her day off or on vacation (I have only gotten through to her once when I said there was no sale now - that got attention, but that's the only time), etc. 
** Bottom line:  I am still waiting for our remote and wheel lock to be FedEx'd. I am still waiting for the title, which I now believe has been submitted. It will be a long time before I look at our new car and not feel exhausted from the process of trying to buy it.  This is not the experience that I have always received from Lexus dealerships. I am a fiercely loyal Lexus fan, and this dealership had a chance to earn future business from us, but never again. **",2018-05-10 14:05:50

Came here for a night after the wedding dinner at the groom's request with family and members of the wedding party.  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Maspero was the groom's favorite spot to dine in NOLA.  There were too many signs that we should have left alot earlier and Maspero has not recovered from Katrina.

First, our table was not ready.  The groom had called to make arrangements for our large party of 20.  Clearly, they were disorganized.  We were instructed that we all had to sit at separate tables.  Fine.

We sat down.  One table got their food before another table had even ordered.  issues with the waitress trying to get our orders straight.  French onion soup arrives cold with two slices of swiss cheese floating on top.  Hello, where is the bubbly melted cheese over crusty bread or crutons?  Waitress ignores our requests to send the soup back.  Other waitress dressed as a gypsy with pink & blue hair advises that our waitress is deaf which helps to explain her incompetence.  the other waitress states, ""why send the food back, just eat it.""  This provokes a response from a guest who whispers under her breath, ""okay, when I get my food and I don't like it, why don't I just throw it at the kitchen.""

At about this time, we take a look at the kitchen which is filled with men who look like they just stepped out of Pirates of the Carribean: Dead men's chest.  We then observe one of the chefs pick his nose and pull our hamburger buns out of the toaster.  At this point, we get up and leave.  

We exit the restaurant and opt for a liquid dinner on Bourbon Street.  As we walk down the side street, we notice that we are at the back of the restaurant and the door is open.  The dishwasher has his left hand down the front of his pants while he sprays the dishes with a nozzle in his right hand.  He then removes his left hand from his pants to pick up the clean dish and place it on the rack.

 Appetizers came out with entrees, all food was tempid to go cool in temperature.  Overall people seemed pleased with the Cuban sandw5. The rest falls into the won't order or return category. 
I had the black bean soup & they wanted to charge me more one for like a tablespoon of rice. I had the fish ala Russo. It arrived heavily breaded with a tiny thin layer of fish between the breading.
 The topping was extremely sparse & did not even have the hard boiled egg. I love this dish and was extremely disappointed that it was over breaded,  overcooke and did not have the appropriate toppings.
I really am quite confused by this restaurant.  All the black bean soup was cold and all they had to do was nuke it. You would think with a group of 9, they would try a bit harder to provide at least warm, edible food.
Personally,  with all the choices for Cuban food in Tampa, I am always eager to try a new restaurant.  I can confidently say I will not eat at this establishment again. Tampa has such a wide variety and offering of great Cuban good, why settle for substandard at inflated prices.
I am not saying this restaurant is expensive, it is not.
 Compared to similar restaurants,  with similar menus on Columbus or Armenia Ave., it is higher priced and offers very little variety in the menu & you have to watch you are not paying for extras.
Perhaps breakfast would be a different story, but I think I will pass.

The valet parking is annoying and I can't see the need for it.   Already entering the bar for the first time and I'm annoyed.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at Brittingham's, annoyed and frustrated.  What's especially frustrating is it has what it needs to be great- good atmosphere, good location, ample space, good drinks- but it can't deliver.  

I remember Brittingham's before it was renovated.  It was a local dive which I had no interest in attending.  They renovated and I thought, ""Okay, let's give it a shot."" So, I went for the first time for a happy hour.  Eh.  It wasn't what I was thinking it would be.  It's fancy, I'll give it that, but it lacks real substance.  The food is a major letdown. (I'd suggest they eliminate the overhead of the valet guys and put that money towards an overhaul of the food.)   The menu can't seem to make up its mind.  Are they going for sophistication (pan seared trout, pickled pepper humus, K2 Mushroom Flatbread) or simple (classic wings, Brittingham's Burger)?   I don't think they have the capacity to handle a mix of both.  I found myself frustrated when looking at the menu.  
 
I went back for Quizzo a few months later, not of my own volition, rather the general consensus of a group.  Good time. The excitement of playing got me through the bad food and nonsense valet parking.  Again, I still felt that spasm of annoyance while looking at the menu and handing my keys to the valet guys.   It reminded me why I hadn't wanted to come back.  

I went back on Thanksgiving Eve to see the band, Secret Service.  Good crowd and a good night.  But, I wasn't eating anything and I didn't drive.   As we left there was a gang of folks waiting for the valet guys and we ended up waiting in line.  Still, the good night wasn't ruined.  I again felt that twinge of annoyance.  

One interaction did annoy me on Thanksgiving Eve.  I paid with my card and politely asked the bartender if there was a minimum for a credit card.  She rolled her eyes at me and said ""No, but there should be.""  She obviously can't grasp the concept that a business should never give people a hard time about paying.   I strongly suggest management sit down with the staff and remind them that single drink credit card transactions may be a nuisance in the moment, but the bottom line is that the customer is paying.

 I thought Brittingham's would be the next MaGerk's.  A hot spot for Lafayette Hill.  You can put in new furniture.  You can have a fancy security camera that shows everyone on a flat screen, enticing people to take selfies, and capture the moment.  Regardless, you just can't get it right.  

I'd advise closing for a night and taking the entire staff over to MaGerk's in Ft. Washington to see how it's done. MaGerk's knows how to do valet parking right.  They have an excellent, simple menu and the bartenders have never given me a look for paying with my card for one drink.  I've also never felt a twinge of annoyance.",2014-12-11 15:28:57

2. Half of the store groceries which seem to be stocked with a lot of everything & not what you need
3. Most of walmarts meats travel days to get to Walmart & it's not quality of meat
4. Not that I shop for clothes in Walmart but they have a small selection in all sizes
5. Cosmetics department has even less than any other Walmart I have ever been to
6. Electronics are so cramped in one little section & again not much to choose from
7. Most walmarts put a little craft section in their walmarts .This one has one aisle

9. The employees are clueless to where thing are 
10. Not enough cashiers to handle the demands of the customers

The design was poorly planned especially for in that area of the city where it should have been made a much bigger SuperWalmart like the ones they do in the suburbs or in towns where there is nothing else around but Super Walmarts
All in all a horrible shopping experience , not a great selection. If I truly needed to go to a Walmart I would rather go to the one in south philly or the far northeast. 
   On another note before I end my review if parents are going for toys for the holidays. They never have them in the store even if they are listed in the ad.. They don't have much of any toys.

The silver lining of this mediocre restaurant is the Smart Roll special, which consists of 16 mini sushi rolls that can be surprisingly fulfilling. However, this deal is only useful for broke college students looking for sustenance. If you want real food, please do your palates and stomach a favor and go elsewhere.",2012-09-11 23:20:37

I was so looking forward to dining here on Friday night when my wife and in-laws came into town to visit while I was working in New Orleans for a few weeks. Made a reservation on Open Table and arrived a few minutes early since we were in the area. We saw some open seating at the bar area with some nice high-top tables and thought the atmosphere looked much more fun in there than the dining room (more formal), so I asked if we could sit in there. Hostess said no problem. 5 minutes later I get an e-mail from Open Table telling me to respect the restaurant and not cancel my reservation so close to the reserved time...while I was sitting in the restaurant! 

Anyways...on to dinner. We ordered a round of drinks and a few apps after waiting about 15 minutes to be acknowledged and then apps came out about 20 minutes later. We ordered a spinach dip which was brought out with no bread (just the dip), no silverware, no plates, and still no drinks. I'll cut through all the waiting, but after ordering our main dishes, we ordered another round of drinks. I ordered a nice glass of bourbon on the rocks and my father-in-law ordered a cocktail prior to dinner. We were done with our meals before they brought them out after I had to go find a manager to ask him to follow-up on our drink orders. Dinner was decent, fried shrimp was overcooked and burnt, but the filet was delicious. 

All in all, food was about 3.5-4 stars and service was 1 star at best. Was expecting much more out of the Bourbon House based on what I had heard from recommendations. Would not recommend.",2019-06-17 14:56:01

The last two times I've ordered their (25) wings, more than half of them have been laughably small. Like they were trying to get rid of the small wings in the batch and I happened to be the lucky one for them to offload them on or something. 

The first time, it was a weekday. A Wednesday, if I remember correctly. It was after 8pm and I was disappointed, but it was the first time it happened so I forgave them. Then today, on a Saturday (11/12) right before Football came on I ordered them again. 45 min to 1 hour later they delivery me another batch of tiny wings. This time, I take pics (which I'll post here) and gave them a call. 

After voicing my complaint to 2 different people and being put on hold 3 times (I guess so they could confer with the cook, manager, or whoever is in charge there), they offer me a choice of giving them the wings back in exchange for a new batch or.......a $3 discount from my next order. Give you the wings back? What are you going to do with tiny wings that were already soggy from sitting in Styrofoam for like 20-40min? Eat them yourself? Give them to another customer? Throw them in the trash? It made no sense to request the wings back. I even told the guy on the phone that I took pics that I could send him if he needed me to. 

Plus, I'd already eaten the 8-9 regular sized wings in the carton. I reluctantly accepted the $3 discount which would only basically cover their delivery fee on my next order. Mind you, I've been ordering from this place for over 10 years and I order wings from them frequently over the past 2 years.

But this server was a trip in how rude she was, I get that it was busy, but she gave attitude when i came in with my son in a stroller, she even asked if we needed to bring him in, in that thing. Well seeing how I was in Indy for a convention and didn't have a car, walking from the Sheraton to the Lucas Oil Stadium. I need a stroller to walk my son the 3 miles we walked daily. 

So we sit down, my mom orders and I order a shake. She gives me attitude because I didn't order food. Ummm I'm ordering something. So my mom's food comes, my son is having some of grandma's fries and of course he drops some food. I always pick up a lot of the food and always leave $5 over 15% to 20% for the mess he leaves behind. I get it's annoying and I try to prevent it. But the distain the server showed was just astonishing. So 15 minutes after my food arrives, I get my m and m milk shake. Or should I saw vanilla shake with a handful of m and m's. 

So as we are checking out this server goes up to the waiting line and said, "" alright which one of you was next. Then a Hispanic group raises their hand and she (a white server) says, ""well rapido let's go get this done!""

They assured me that would be the price. I walked out paying $185.00.

The experience started poorly as soon as we walked through the door.  You enter right into dining room. There's no reception area, no hostess desk. Because there's no hostess. Or even a sign to tell you whether to wait or seat yourself. After a couple minutes, I had to ask a patron to find out that it's seat yourself. After we were seated, we witnessed a couple walk into the restaurant, linger at the door for a minute, then turn around and leave when they weren't helped.

After taking a seat, we waited a few more minutes before the server approached our table to ask if we'd ordered yet.  From whom, I wondered, if not you, our server? Keep in mind, this is like 3 in the afternoon - they weren't in the weeds.

And to make matters worse, the server was unfriendly. No smile to greet us, no smile at any point in the meal. And not very helpful, either. My wife asked what the house made potato chips were like, she responded ""I don't know, they're chips"".  She might have said something like ""oh, they're sliced thin, fried in peanut oil, and dusted with sea salt and Parmesan"", but no, her helpful response was ""they're chips"". At the end of the meal, she came to clear our table, and said she'd bring our check. No offer of dessert. As we were leaving, nobody offered up a ""Thanks for coming in"", even though we walked right past the table where the ostensible owners were seated.

All that out of the way, let's move on to the food.  The brisket was ok. The regular sandwich is a little on the small side, but not too bad. The pulled pork was good, moist and flavorful. The Rueben was good; very generous with the corned beef, which tasted very good. 

Side notes: the fries were good (we didn't order the chips), and the Caesar salad was good. The pulled pork BBQ beans came out mushy, almost the consistency of refried beans, with little to no pork in evidence. The three sauces offered are good, but nothing special.

To sum up, 1) Don't leave your customers wondering what to do; 2) Train your staff in friendly customer service; and 3) Scrupulously watch food quality. There's too much good BBQ in this town for sub-par product to survive.",2014-08-24 21:53:10

They quoted 5 tons of rock for top dress but it obviously was not enough or mis judged the job.

Completely missed an entire row of established Hawthorne's and if I had not been checking, would not have cared. When tearing out front yard plants to replace with desert tolerant ones, they knocked of an electrical box on a freshly painted house and never placed it back on correctly- they just caulked it crooked with extra thick glob of silicone.

She started doing my toes I can tell that she was not in a good mood or like she didn't want to be there, but I didn't mind because we all have bad days.

She spoke a different language to the lady that was doing my sisters nails. The lady ended up coming over looked at my toe then took the cuticle cutter and started to cut my cuticle in the same spot where the other one cut me. Once I realized she had already cut me even more, they ended up putting that liquid on my toe to stop the bleeding but the blood wouldn't stop. She finished my other toes which I was not happy she didn't even clean them properly I had to go home and cut my own cuticles. On top of all of it she put the nail color on top of the blood from the toe that was bleeding.

As a wife of a restaurant owner with 17 years of experience and still a current part time waitress, I'm very aware and considerate of newly established restaurants. We were greeted by the owner- who in the beginning was very friendly. She took our name down for the wait and was called maybe 5 minutes later to come back inside to be seated. 

After waiting several minutes after being seated, she came back over and told us that none of her servers wanted to wait on us- so it would be her taking care of us. Great! We thought. Friend ordered sweet tea, and was told they only make unsweetened and would have to sweeten it herself. Ok? She returned and said they were out of tea and suggested something else. It was 830, quite a few tables, why not brew more tea for your customer? I ordered a sangria, and after 15 minutes i asked another waitress where it was when she brought out the fried green tomatoes. (By the way, you only get 4 pieces for $7). The waitress brought me not 1, but 2 sangrias and said hopefully i wasn't charged for 2. The manager returned and disappointedly asked why i had 2. 

The food was VERY overpriced for the quality and quantity served. Friend ordered grouper sandwich and after having already ordered it a while back, manager informed her they were out of grouper. She got the mahi instead, said it was very bland, even though she got it blackened. I ordered half a dozen fried oyster basket for $14. The fries came out cold, and the oysters were no bigger than a nickel. When i questioned the manager, she was obviously very offended. She didn't take constructive criticism well, at all. She told me that's what happens to oysters when you cook them. Repeatedly asked ""well what do you want me to do"" in a tone that was quite inappropriate and unprofessional. THEN! She asked ""do you want me to go over there and buy you a steak, what do you want me to do?"" There is NO steak on their menu. Her passive aggressiveness and lack of knowledge in how to treat customers was appalling. During this time, my ""$11 add on of a crab leg cluster"" came out and i literally laughed out loud. They were scrawny, cold, over cooked so much to where they were soft and the shell wouldn't crack. The  meat was almost cooked gone! I told her this is absurd to pay for such poor quality food. She basically gave us the , well it is what it is vibe and to kick rocks. I Requested some more oysters and was going to just call it a Day. My second half a dozen of anorexic oysters came out, burnt, and she came over to see If i was satisfied. I said yes, this works thank you. Her reply was ""good girl"". WHAT IN THE WORLD?!. I rarely complain, and it takes a lot for me to be offended. I have to be real ticked off to leave a negative review. 

We all still tipped 20%, and i left her a note to hopefully educate her on how to treat patrons. I hope that she was able to learn and share her experience with her servers. This restaurant is part of John's pass village boardwalk and i will be surprised If i see it here next year. I've been coming to Madeira beach for 26 years, unless they change their prices, quality of food, quantity of food and ownership, they could really be in for it.

Our server had very little knowledge of the menu and did not know how to open a bottle of wine. Another server came over for assistance and opened it but dripped wine all over the table when pouring. He also had very little knowledge of the menu. I would think before opening they would have had the servers taste the menu.

We had a party of 6 and no one liked their meal. The food also did not come out at the same time. 

Steak - no flavor
Roasted Chic - no sauce and the ""roasted cauli"" is a garnish (size of minced garlic) but the menu makes it sound like a side. 
Brussels - tasted like they were pre-steamed then fried. Too oily to eat. 
Shrimp Tacos - 3 super tiny torts (size of a cookie) with salad shrimp
Cheese curds - not bad

The menu is pretty weak and it seemed like they got overwhelmed pretty easy.

Update August 2018:

We decided to give them another shot since they have been open for some time now. It was 2pm last Saturday and we decided to sit at the bar. There was a bartender and I assume a manager behind the bar. The bartender disappeared and the manager continued to speak to a couple at the bar for 10 minuets.

The one of the only good things about this restaurant is how the food tastes. So now for the negatives; First off the parking is terrible (there is only street parking), the wait for food takes way to long, even on the less busy days, the food is unreasonably expensive, and they crammed so many tables inside and outside at an attempt to accommodate more customers but because of that the seating is extremely cramped and you basically sit next to the people around you.

When our plates came out, the chicken and waffles looked very sad and did not have a ""wow factor"" to it. The piece of chicken we received was a lot smaller than the waffle so the proportion seemed a little off. My steak and eggs was the better of the 2 dishes. It was a flank steak with chimichurri on top alongside some fruits, potatoes and eggs.

Other things to note is that the ambiance is very nice but the bathroom compared to it is what I would expect from a diner, like Denny's. Very basic.

We go inside and see a sign that says please wait to be seated. Theirs no hostess/waitress in sight. We see a booth up front and almost set ourselves, but decide not to be disrespectful and wait for the hostess. The hostess walks in the front door (she was outside smoking her cigarette) greets the 2 men behind us and ignores us. She then talks to them about where they'd like to sit, still ignoring us even though we were there first, and tells them they can sit downstairs at the booth up front and seats them. She turns around and we let her know that we've been waiting for a table, she says she can seat us upstairs. Normally that wouldn't be an issue, but my husband just had knee surgery and is in an immobilizer and can not climb stairs. She then tells us she has no tables for us and we can put our name in to be seated. I point to an open table up front that seats 5 and she says we can't sit there. She tries to out us in a tiny table for 2 that again my husband can't sit at because of his leg. We ask again to sit at the larger table she tells us ""I told you, you can't sit there"". 

Needless to say, we speak to a manager to explain the situation and let her know how unfriendly her hostess was, and the manager told us that the hostess was trying to greet us and we weren't paying attention.

I've really been back and forth about changing my review but today pushed me a bit over the edge. I've been coming here a few times a week for the past year so I know what times are usually good to avoid a crowd. I work up the street so I usually give myself an extra 25 - 30 minutes to make sure I'm able to stop here because the drinks are great. However, the last few months the staff has changed and has become very unfriendly and slow. Not to mention, a customer in front of me ordered a drink with apple juice or something in it and the barista couldn't get the pouch open and opened it with HIS TEETH. I'm happy the customer demanded a new drink and for him to get scissors because if she didn't I would have. So unsanitary. He huffed and puffed about it too which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, today I walked into Starbucks at 7:40am. My work is 2 minutes up the road so in my mind I had plenty of time. I walked in and saw two customers ahead of me so I figured it'd be a 5 minute wait at best. That wasn't the case at all. Every person working I've never seen before. Someone had to be new because I didn't even get to order my drink until 7:50. I ordered a sandwich and a vanilla latte macchiato. The cashier double checked everything which I was happy about because at this point I'm already irritated by the wait. Not to mention the line behind me is now outrageous, at 7:50am on a Saturday. No events or anything we're going on nearby. As I'm waiting 15 minutes I notice that people who ordered after me start getting their drinks. The barista has a drink sitting at the bar which was a caramel macchiato. I pick it up and see it's my order because the correct order is written on the cup, I explained to her it was not my order and she said she'd make another. No apology but I wasn't about to wait while the line kept growing. I just took the drink and left. Horrible service. Sorry to say I won't be back because when they can make a drink it's delicious.

This place needs to evaluate their management structure from a district level, they're obviously not checking on the store, training the  manager and coaching the staff. So terribly mismanaged. A. the store is always dirty. B. They are the most unfriendly staff, only greeting you (half the time) when you walk on since their sound a capacity count. C.

E. staff would walk by me and not engage or greet me like many other stores do in this area. F. the cashier's ball up your clothes instead of nicely folding it in your bag. I ALWAYS have to refold it so it doesn't look like I sat on it on the way home before giving my kids the shirts I just bought them. 
Last night, more notably, after I gave the store loss prevention person a look, a cashier finally came to help the other cashier, after I waited behind 3 woman with full shopping carts. She asked how I was and I said annoyed and then she dropped it. So for future reference, when a customer tells you they're annoyed, they obviously have something they want to say, engage them!!!

I do hate the corporate devil, but shopping local after 8 becomes problematic. I had problems with the place, discussed them with both management and corporate, and decided to go my way, had to drop back by yesterday. Wish I hadn't.

Yesterday I had two very negative experiences over in the garden department. Short of it was I had to come back with a larger vehicle otherwise I would not have had two, only one... let's set the scene here

12:20 on Sunday - Garden department, 1 woman working, 4 people in line, 1 customer asking for help with some rakes. After checking out the man she was helping she left the remaining people in line to go help getting down a rake. This involved climbing and eventually calling for help. She apologized and mentioned she's not supposed to be the only one working. An angry man came out and mentioned things like this were why they had bad reviews online (I'm assuming either the inability to get a rake down, or leaving 4 people in line to fail at getting a rake. not sure. That was 15 minutes of my life. It took a very long time for the rake issue to be resolved and I think I was getting checked out by the time it did.

Walk out and there're 2 people filling up a watering can sprinkler, guessing they were the other people who were working the garden department.

I come back with the larger vehicle to pick up the other item I needed - basically it was a foot too long for a car. Grabbed it, get in line, the cashier is explaining that she's waiting on something. 10 minutes later she's just standing there doing nothing. The people in front of me leave, then the next person, and I headed up front carrying a vary large item as there's no movement.

Of course nothing has a price tag, and nobody can look it up on the computer, a manager I assume comes over says she's get it taken care of. I stand around for 9 minutes in line and nobody comes back with a price and the cashier I'm at the end of the line never will talk to me as she's helping other customers. Basically abandoned, pretty much like everyone in the garden department was.

I leave finally seeing that nobody is going to pay any attention.

I'd parked near the garden center, so I walked back in on the way out, the person who said she would get a price was at the desk trying to instruct a register operator in how to do things. I tried to tell the price checking person that I was leaving, but she was too wrapped up with the disaster that was there that she wouldn't turn around.

Yeah... that was yesterday

Throughout the years, I've had fun with this one... it's continually been the driving force to keep me not considering Walmart except in extreme conditions. I've been in touch with corporate many many a time on this place, and the last time I was the management made it a point to not have a voicemail so there was no way you could contact them, you'd call and it would ring nonstop. Using a landline I once just let it go. 4 hours later someone picked up.

It's a shame too, as Walmart goes, the store *looks* great. It just operates like it's run by a loony bin.

Other fun events here are a cashier who thinks that if something doesn't scan (not found in the inventory) and the second item of the same thing doesn't scan that you should keep going until you find one that does. no, they all have the same barcode. Call a manager.

Honestly, it's every other time I go there it's an unpleasant experience. Roughly every 5th time I'd say ranks up with me wanting to break something. I see people walking out of the lines every time I go there, just giving up. It's absurd.",2012-04-30 20:00:05

They have a website but no info on it, which was odd in the 21st century. So it was mostly yelp related buzz, from some yelpers I trust about important things like sandwiches. I have to say, I don't get the buzz after eating here. I must be missing something, clearly.

For the price of an expensive po boy (expensive by the rubric of one state away from Louisiana where the chef personally drives back to NO every week for breads to keep things authentic) you get what passes for the equivalent of ""oh honey, you certainly did try, didn't you?"" And it is cash only which just calls more attention to the cost of the po boy as you count it out, rather than swipe it out.

The bread is definitely the best part, of what you can taste that is not utterly soaked in enough grease to see the deity of other peoples' religions like a strange LSD trip, except the greasy kind where it is clogging your heart and you remember that your estate planning affairs are not exactly in order at the moment. 

My dining companion had the grilled cheese in which the bread was blackened, charred beyond all recognition. My dining companion's comment was that if this was made at home, it would have been thrown out in the trash and a second attempt would have been made if you had any respect for yourself.

Mine was essentially something that should only be eaten in the case of if you hate yourself, or if you are so blacked out drunk that you would stick anything in your mouth at that point, which I am led to believe is how the iPhone app grindr works. Considering the ""small"" size of the po boy as compared to the po boy kings and queens of Houston (that are graduates of the hard knock life in NOLA) I was expecting super high quality food ingredients and attention to detail in the po boy here. This isn't an all you can eat buffet where quantity trumps quality. 

The quality was nowhere to be found though; neither was the quantity. As much as I have in common with David Sedaris the complaint that ""this is awful"" usually has to go hand in hand with ""and there wasn't even enough of it""

Independent places are cool. The food truck scene is cool. The food trucks moving into brick and mortar spaces, like is hot in Houston right now, is an acceptable thing. Sub par food and overpriced wares are never in vogue, so far as I know.

I ordered at the drive-thru then waited an extended period of time to pay as the window worker shot the breeze with the customer in front of me. Eventually I pulled to the window and paid. The woman who was talking tried to give me my drinks, only two of the three I ordered. I asked for the missing drink and she blamed it on one of the workers who was actually working. I was then told that they did not have enough food to ready to fill my order and or would take 5 minutes until î world be ready. This would have be nice to know when I ordered but hey it was oknot five minutes. I pulled forward and waited. About five minutes later the woman from the drinks exited the store with a bag of food and started toward my car. She then turned away and entered a parked car. Two minutes later she exited the car and took the bag of food back into the store. Another worker then came out carrying what looked like the same bag of food. At this point everything just did not seem right. When I questioned the worker about the extra time and what the other woman was doing with the bag she became very nervous and could not explain why the order took so long and why other woman was walking around with the food. The whole experience was just weird. I don't think I will be going back here anytime soon.",2018-08-15 01:54:52

I do however really like McDonald's breakfast especially their coffee.  This place is literally less than 5 minutes fro my apartment.  I come in around 7:30 or 7:45 several mornings a week.  The drive thru is always long and the staff inside of the McDonalds is ALWAYS slow.  The employees are nice but my goodness they take their sweet time.  I am not the most patient person in the morning but it should not take me 10 minutes to order a large coffee.  There are usually no more than 1 or 2 customers in line ahead of me.

It happened to me this week and I felt like I had officially taken part in a Philly initiation ritual-- hooray. 

Unfortunately Tow Decision was responsible for towing my car-- this was honestly THE SHADIEST business I have ever come across in my 25 years of life (and I lived next door to a drug front pizza place in college that was more legit than this place). It begins here: I stumbled home delirious in the 100 degree heat, notice my car is gone, feel like it is a mirage and then have that moment where I'm like ""holy sh*t where the eff is my car!?"" I call up Tow Decision, the line is busy for the first 5 times I call, then I finally hear a voice on the line and I ask how to get my car back.

He tells me no info-- tells me to ""check the sign and that he'll have one of his guys there till 9"". So we drive out to Aramingo Ave, expecting to feel like I am in the most ridiculous episode of Broad City or Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and my expectations were met. We pull up to the tow place to find a naked woman peeing outside of the barbed wire entrance to the tow yard. Where the fuhhh am I? I think to myself. 

No one greets us, so I wait. Finally I see who I guess is the guy who works there's girlfriend who yells and the guy comes outside. He meets me at the barbed wire fence and tells me it'll be $200. Cool, it could've been worse I think to myself. I hand him my credit card and he goes uhhh nah we are cash only-- PARDON ME?! You expect me to show up to your tow yard with  Benjamins in hand?? And exact change? 

So off to Wawa we go-- taking out hundreds of dollars in cash in a terrible neighborhood. We survive, but not without a panhandler telling us to f**k off when we won't give them cash. Pull back up the tow yard. Give the dude the cash through the fence BEFORE he even shows me my car and I'm like cool he could just take my cash and not give me my car back, which seems reasonable at this point. 

The guy pulls up with my car, and off I go. Now that I have warned all of youz on Yelp I'll be erasing this experience from my mind.",2016-07-10 17:07:11

Before ordering our meal, we noticed a man at the table next to us who seemed quite upset and ended up sending his meal back to be replaced. I understand things like this happen, but this only seemed to continue. I ordered the grilled scallops and shrimp meal and thought it was a great meal at as awesome price. My friend, on the other hand, ordered crab legs, which came out cold to the point where the meat was unattainable. When she told Sasha, the waitress, about her cold meal, she was not apologetic at all. Her meal was re-made and served steaming hot, as crab legs should be! 

Sasha did not seem to be enthused at all about her job, and while I understand people have bad nights, this is still your job... We are from Minnesota, so when we asked Sasha for her opinion on meals, all she said was ""everything is great""... OK!? The restaurant was not busy at all by the time we were served, yet she barely came around to ask if we needed anything. When she eventually did come back to ask if we needed anything, she so quickly assumed we were fine, as she had already started to turn away. We had to hail her back, as we were interested in getting another drink. Unfortunately our whole dinner talk was about the awful service we were receiving. Near the end of our meal, we actually saw another couple across from us return their meal. The woman looked absolutely disgusted, and as they got up to leave after paying for their drinks, we kindly asked why they sent their meal back. They had found a very long hair in their burger... yuck! The fact that we saw two tables return meals and we ourselves had to return one is absolutely ridiculous. 

We were referred to check this place out, and left very unhappy. I will not be returning to this particular location when I return to Clearwater Beach. 

Some tips:
1. If you work in this type of business, put on a happy face and act like you want to be there... Even if you don't want to. That is how you get your tips, and Sasha most definitely did not earn a great one.

2. When (at least) 3 meals are returned within an hour, this should be a sign that management should step in and analyze the meals before they are served. 

3. When meals ARE returned, the manager on shift should be the one to bring out the new meal to apologize and cater to their unhappy guests. This is your chance for a clean slate with your guest, and potentially turn a bad experience into a great one. 

Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience here. I feel that with the right staff and more professional management, this location could be much more successful!",2015-04-27 15:58:10

I was assured by an associate my ring would come with a basic warranty since it was over a certain price. Within a month one of the little diamonds on the band had fallen out. I didn't panic too much because I knew about the warranty and it wasn't noticeable unless I had pointed it out to someone. I decided I didn't want to jump in and get it fixed right away since I had only been wearing it for a month.

Not even two weeks later, another one of the diamonds on the band falls out. I called the local Zales and they told me I needed to contact the customer service line since I bought it online. Once I got through to someone, I gave him our account information and told him what happened to the ring. He told me as long as I have it looked at by an associate inside the local Zales every six months then the warranty on my ring will be honored and the diamonds will be replaced at no cost to me.

I printed out a form that was e-mailed to me about the warranty and the local Zales assured me that they would keep it on file for future repairs. Since we had to send it out to be repaired anyways, I asked to have my ring resized down to a 5. I knew I would have to pay extra for it since I didn't buy the full warranty and that was no problem to me at all. 

I was told it would take 3 weeks before my ring would be back since they had to send it out to two different locations. I waited 5 weeks until I finally got a call saying it was ready to be picked up. I tried it on and asked if they resized it because it didn't feel any different. The guy helping me told me they resized it to a 5. I had him take my ring and double check on their sizing tool to make sure it was in fact a 5. Turns out, they didn't resize it as requested. So I had to send it out once again and wait for it's return.

They didn't charge me for the resizing which was nice since we did have to send it back out again. They were really apologetic and sincere about it (hence my reason for 2 stars instead of 1).

This was back in September of 2016. Beginning of November, once again I noticed a diamond had fallen out. My boyfriend and I were in the mall Christmas shopping and decided to stop into Zales to see what the deal was. The girl 'helping' us looked up my account and told me I didn't have warranty on my ring and I would have to pay to have it fixed. I asked her to double check because I just sent my ring in to be fixed under the warranty plan during the summer and didn't pay a dime. Again, she told me there is no warranty on this ring and I wouldn't be able to get it fixed unless I paid out of pocket for it. She seemed so apathetic and uncaring towards the situation. Not knowing what else to do or who to talk to, we left. We paid over $500 for this ring and didn't want to put anymore money into it.

It's now February 12 and I noticed ANOTHER diamond is missing which is what prompted me to write this review. I will never buy another ring from Zales again. We're looking at engagement rings elsewhere to replace this promise ring.",2017-02-13 05:01:34

On arrival we were informed that only one of us had an appointment at 11:30. Instead, mine was scheduled until forty five minutes later. Of course none of this was mentioned at the time we made our appointments. When I said as much, the receptionist informed (heavy on the condescension) that they would never double book appointments... as if I should somehow know their scheduling policies. My husband was not seen for more than thirty minutes after his appointment time. Regarding my appointment, the year prior I paid for an in house doctors exam. They told me that as long as I came before the 365th day, it would count towards this year's card. However, the cash-grabbing clinic refused to honor that and left me scrambling to pull and provide other current records via email. All while sitting in the lobby! The only other option, they said, was to pay for a SECOND exam, at their office, in under one calendar year. Oh and to top it off, they only have FOUR parking spaces behind the building and are in  a down and dirty feud with a neighboring strip mall over parking.

My coworker and me came in at 11:15 am, they were suppose to be open at 11:00 am. My dad owns a Thai Restaurant too and he's always there 2-3 hours before opening to prep all the vegetables, meats, and noodle. So I had a feeling already it would be bad since they came in late. We decided to order, fresh shrimp rolls and medium beef pho. I love the fresh roll there, it's the best of all the places I have been to in TN. When the pho came out, I took my chopstick to stir up the bundle of noodle only to find the noodles where tiny little 3-4 inch strands chunks and not bundle. My coworker got the same thing. Not only where they short but they were super soggy. The new rice noodle usually have to be submerge in water to for about 30-45min to soften them up. And they just opened not 15 minutes ago. So it led me to think these are probably old strands from leftovers from yesterday night. I would be able to accept if they told us the truth and offer us alternatives for their lack of responsibility for opening late, but instead they gave us half-assed pho and expect us to eat it. Really disappointed me because I really liked their pho. But what disappointed me the most was the fact they try to sell that to their customers. Which makes me wonder what else have they doing to cut corners?

Overall I won't be eating there again. I am too paranoid on what else they are doing to cut down cost. And the fact they have the moral and ethnics to serve that to customers kills me.",2015-12-16 21:47:03

We don't expect haute cuisine from a fast food restaurant, but we do not believe that a modicum of competency, consistency, and, dare I say, professionalism is outside the realm of expect-able outcome on a two-item order with no special requests.  Chain restaurants and franchises' strength is generally in their consistency and speed.

Apparently not, on Ms. Rodriguez, (and Mr. Burge's) watch.

No hash browns, so french fries with breakfast (!) on a Sunday mid-morning.  Incompetent at best (someone needs an inventory system).  Still, I would have chalked that one up to an unfortunate glitch, IF it were the only issue.

Then, there's the order.  Two breakfast items with no 'special' requests for takeout.  Can't screw that up, right?  Wrong.  Paid for a biscuit with egg and cheese - it was entered correctly in the system, but... got served a biscuit with cheese - no egg.

Oh, dear readers.  Don't think incompetence stops there... Did I mention that my takeout order, which they got wrong, took over 15 minutes to fulfill???  Yup.  15 minutes, waiting for a two-item takeout order to be filled.  So on top of incompetence, we add ""untimely.""  But wait, there's more...

Most chains have web-based customer service contacts baked into their receipts, to prevent exactly the kind of reviews this is.  Well... that's all fine and wonderful if they GIVE you a receipt, which this Hardees did not.  All I have is the tickets that were taped to the order, which do not contain the information Hardees' ""Customer Service"" site requires.  Instead, I had to call the restaurant, listen to a litany of excuses from Mr. Burge that was glaringly devoid of any offer of resolution starting with, dare I suggest, ""Can we replace the order with corrected items?""  You'd think that would be the first logical suggestion.  Nope.  So I insisted on escalating, and was given Ms. Kathy Rodriguez as contact.  Congratulations Ms. Rodriguez, you've been tossed under the proverbial ""bus"" by Mr. Burge.

I've gone off on my ""you have one job to do"" rant so many other times, it's almost overkill here.  Incomplete order, unsatisfactory food inventory of 'staple' items, no receipt, and no customer resolution path.  THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the organization run by Mr. Burge and Ms. Rodriguez.  I can't say how Hardees is doing in other markets, but this store's ready for a wrecking ball.  Mr. Burge, Ms. Rodriguez  - no worries --   I'm sure there's work at the post office.

We first ordered a spring roll sampler, which we thought would provide us with a nice ""sample"" of each different kind of spring roll offered on the menu.  It consisted of 1 peking duck roll with soggy duck and mostly scallion, 1 chicken spring roll with ALL VEGETABLES and NO CHICKEN save for 1 or 2 tiny pieces in the very last bite, 1 shrimp spring roll with ALL VEGETABLES and NO SHRIMP throughout with the exception of one tiny BABY shrimp in (AGAIN) the very last bite, and 1 vegetable spring roll ALL VEGETABLES (of course).  It was like we ordered 1 Peking Duck roll and 3 BLAND, soggy, horrible vegetable rolls.  We cut the rolls in half searching for chicken and shrimp.  HOW PATHETIC is that?

Then we split an order of Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp.  The Pad Thai was SOOO incredibly bland and stuck together that we had to request some kind of sauce, any kind of sauce would've (honestly) spruced it up a little, but the waiter suggested the sauce that went with it.  HUH?  There was a sauce that went with it?  There was no evidence of any sauce in OUR dish.  Ahh that was just what it needed, much better.  Then it was actually not bad, maybe even pretty good.

But, Alas, it was too little too late for us.  LESSON:  You shouldn't have to request to add sauce to a dish that should've already had sauce in the first place.

The staff was so-so. Some of the waitresses were very nice (saying ""welcome take a seat anywhere you would like"" and ""enjoy your holidays"" when you left) but our server seemed to be kind of rude- she filled our water glasses without saying hello or giving a smile, and she hardly gave my sister and I any time to look over the menu- she filled the water, walked away, came back and said ""are you ready to order"" not even 5 minutes later. 

I quickly chose the Pad Thai with tofu and added vegetables to it. About 10 minutes later, both my sister's and my entree came out. 2 entrees made in 10 minutes? Something's a bit fishy there. It just doesn't seem possible to make 2 entrees from scratch in less than 10 minutes without using a microwave. And I could tell by the taste of the food too. The pad thai was bland and didn't have that sweet & tangy taste like pad thai should have. It had no peanuts in it either, which is a part of pad thai. The tofu and vegetables were mushy. And, Aroy's idea of making a dish spicy is using cayenne pepper powder and not using authentic Thai chili peppers. The cayenne pepper powder would just clump up in the noodles, which shows a lack of effort to make a dish spicy and authentic. Sad!

I was in the process of taking our church kids to the white mountains for camp.  I ended up renting a van to take the kids up and had my van towed to get worked on.   While at camp I get a call from the Manager saying that I needed a new MASS air flow sensor.  I know nothing about cars so I trusted that was the problem. After all, I need my van running before I got back from camp so I could get to work.  A couple of hours latter, I get another call from them telling me I need a new fuel pump.  I cringed when they told me the price on the total repair, but told me they gave me a discount to make it all fit in my financing approval.  Since I needed to get to work when I got back I told them ok.  At least My van will be running.  After getting back from camp, I called to let them know I was coming in to pick up the van.  They told me that it wasn't ready yet because they accidentally broke my ignition.  (how does that even happen?)  I had to wait til the next day to pick up my van.  Everything seemed to work just fine until a week later when I tried to start the van it started and just died exactly the same way it did the first time.  I was pretty upset and now very broke, so I called them to send me a tow truck to get my van in the shop.  It took a couple of hours before the tow truck came to my house.  When i talked to the tow truck driver, he said he remembers my van, and remembers picking my van up last week.  When I asked how he wanted me to get my van out  of the parking space he told me that last week my van just started right up and asked if the van doesn't start.  I was like ""no, the van doesn't start, that is why I called you to tow it.""  I thought it was really weird that the van started for him last week.  So when I tried starting the van the Van started!!  Why it wouldn't start just a couple of hours ago was besides me. Obviously there was something wrong because it should start every time and not stall.  Plus I just spent around $1,000 on repairs.  I dropped the van off and latter got a call from Fletchers saying there is nothing wrong that they can see with the van.  I got my van back and it ran good for about a week again and then it wouldn't start.  When talking to my friends about it, one friend told me that it sounds like I have a problem with my PASSLOCK security system.  Upon researching the symptoms of a faulty PASSLOCK, I found it to be exactly what is wrong with my Van.  I performed the reset procedure as described on the Website, and the Van started right up!  My van's passlock is what is causing my Van to not start.  A couple of times a week I have to do a reset procedure to get my van running, and It is very upsetting that I am paying $1,000 to repairs that have nothing to do with my problem.  Fletchers mis-diagnosted my problem, and put repairs in my van that was not needed.  Upon talking to another mechanic, he told me that when the tow driver started my van and drove it on the flat bed, that should of been the first sign that the fuel pump worked and wasn't causing the stalling.  He also told me that a bad Mass Air flow sensor would show up  an error code or check engine light.  My van had neither.  Although I know how to start my van when the Passlock fails,  I am irritated that My repair bill should reflect a fixed problem, now I have to make payments with my van still not fixed!  I feel they just maxed my finance approval out because they could, and I was desperate to have a working Van.  I believe that they didn't ""break my ignition"" because I never got proof of the work order.  I believe they had the same problem I had with the van not starting and told me it was a broken ignition!  I will be taking this to the BBB if I don't get some kind of compensation.

I could tell my parents were not comfortable and the tabletop was sticky, so I asked the host to be moved when I saw two booths become free. He was really rude in his response, saying that if we wanted a booth we shouldn't have taken a high table. I pointed out that they gave away our booth to a walk-in, which is why we took the high table, instead of apologizing he asked me ""which group"" and made me point out in the room. He then told me they did have a reservation, which I find odd since I was behind them in the queue and never heard them say that.

A place has to be very good or very bad for me to care enough to write a yelp, Asian Noodles tonight was a very bad experience. 

Went here because it was right by Costco and I had seen it advertised in the Sunday Church Bulletin. 

I went in and after waiting for a couple of minutes I asked to see the take out menu (the sign on the front said fast food). After waiting about 8 minutes or so someone finally asked me what I wanted and took my order. I then had a 15-ish minute wait, thus a total wait time of over 25 minutes. Hardly, fast food as the sign out front advertised! 

I would of been ok with the wait if the food had been good and the staff friendly, but the staff were not friendly and the resulting food was totally subpar! The spring rolls were pure lettuce with no herbs and my main meal dish Ma Po Tofu was too salty, not spicy enough, and besides Tofu had NO vegetables except 3 small carrot silvers and what looked liked canned mushrooms, vegetarians like vegetables!!!!!  

Moreover, they had packed my food in a sloppy manner and in the wrong type of containers for the food type, it didn't make it home without a massive amount spilling out of the containers. For the amount I paid, the food should of been much better.

I haven't ridden the bus (the #56/26 from Due West in Madison) to downtown in a couple years because I don't trust it to be on time. Not even the first bus of the morning, which is what I frequently rode before gas prices went down. Barring illness or an accident, I don't understand how the first bus of the morning can be late, but it often was. But on Sat. 6/11 I decided to try it again. And the bus was on time! Yay! So I figured there would be no problem.

Wrong. In spite of the fact that there was no copious number of stoplights, and no wheelchair passengers, the driver just putzed along like he had all day, and, by the time we got downtown, I ran up the stairs just in time to see my connection (the #7) pulling onto 5th Ave. Even though the bus had arrived in Madison on time, it was late getting downtown by four or five minutes. And I wasn't the only person who got stuck, another Vandy co-worker did too. So I had to wait another 40 minutes and now have a black mark at work for being more than a half an hour late.

I will never trust an MTA bus again, and will tell anyone I know the same thing. I can't take the stress of not knowing. I'll call a cab or an Uber if I have to. If it's been so difficult, for so many years, for the first bus of the morning to be on time, why isn't it sent out five minutes earlier? All this talk about expanding bus service is ridiculous. The bus seems to only be for the benefit of tourists or people who have no set schedule; those of us who really need it live and die by the whims of personnel who seemingly don't have to be at their own jobs on time. Doesn't anyone monitor these things? GPSes? Radios? I don't get it.

Occasionally I have terrible flare-ups that I just can't get under control at home sometimes that involve uncontrollable vomiting and I usually am extremely dehydrated by the time I get to the ER so I always request getting IV fluids as soon as possible because it helps me so much. 
I spent an hour in the ER waiting room(technically the ER bathroom since I couldn't stop vomiting and didn't want to disturb other patients in the waiting room) and was finally triaged....then sent back to the waiting room for almost another hour of waiting. 

When I did finally get taken back, I warned the nurses of how hard a stick I was, especially being so dehydrated. THIRTEEN sticks later (even using the ultrasound) they finally listened to me when I told them they would only get a stick in my hand. 

I could go on and on about how the PA didn't take me seriously about anything we tried to tell her. We have been dealing with this and know what needs to be done. She eventually made up her own diagnosis and had them rub capsaicin cream all over my already aching guts causing even more extreme pain and burning. After this, we asked to leave.

They made us sign papers saying ""we were leaving knowing they could still treat me more,"" but I was tired of not getting the IV fluids I needed and being accused of having sicknesses I don't have while this PA played science experiments on me. 

We drove to another ER...for the IV fluids I desperately needed, got them, and went home fine. 

The doctors and PAs need to stop pretending they know everything and actually LISTEN to their patients. They do not at this ER location.",2020-01-24 22:27:52

I've taken Bikram and hot yoga before in other cities, but hadn't done it in years, so I was excited to try it again. Signing up online was easy and they offered lots of class times. The studio itself was huge and since there was only 6 people in my class we had plenty of room to stretch out. However, I won't go back, mostly because I forgot how repetitive bikram is! Unlike hot yoga where the poses and order of poses can vary, in bikram it is the same poses in the exact same order every class so the only difference between classes is how good the teacher is.  Unfortunately the teachers here just weren't good. One teacher I had seemed annoyed I didn't remember all the poses and needed more specific instruction and another talked incessantly throughout the whole class and made it feel like he was performing a monologue while simultaneously singling out students and telling them to not even try because they weren't even close to being ready (not even offering any modifications, just telling them to stand there).

The style appears to be something approximating southern home cooking although The Abbey calls itself a gastropub. If you have knowledge of either cuisine it will strike you as having no resemblance whatsoever to either gastropub or southern quality home cooking. In stark contrast to those hand-wrought cuisines, The Abbey is what one fears/expects to find in a mid-priced national chain hotel lobby restaurant.  

You know when you have lots of food left on your plate but choose not to take any home? Yeah, that bad.

I intended to write this review as feedback directly to Paesanos, but rather than give an email their website directs people to yelp and Facebook.  I hope they read yelp!

First- Put your email on the website.  

Second- Please do something about your new Girrard location.  My wife and I went this weekend and agreed it missed the mark by any standard- and by Paesano's standards: shockingly unacceptable.  The brisket & corn soup was tasteless and forgettable.  The Bolognese sandwich - something tasted off and the bread roll wasn't your normal great quality.  My wife had tuna fish she thought was just okay (she usually loves this)

We have foodie friends (also Paesano fans) who went yesterday and they had the same experience.  

My friend's summary: ""The Tuscan Tony was just a mush of stuff and the foundation, the dog itself, not up to his meat standards. The Giardino, his take on an eggplant parm, was an OK sandwich, just not something I'd go out of my way to Girard for.    But maybe they just weren't well executed? Because the most worrisome thing was that the delicate and brilliantly conceived balance of flavors on my fave, the Gustaio, were definitely off... ""

Service: Our waitress was texting WHILE I was ordering. I thought it was some kind of new tablet system that sent the orders to the kitchen. Until I got done and she said, ""sorry, what was that again?"" and she pulled out a notepad for me to repeat my order. Come on. 

Atmosphere: Weird. It was part Applebee's and part Famous Dave's. Had a feeling of weirdness all around. 

BBQ: Most disappointing. We each had a sandwich, one pulled pork, one chicken, one brisket. All were served on a LeBus roll that had no business housing BBQ. The tops of the bread were so big they were discarded by each of us, while the thin bottom let you holding a soggy piece of roll covered in meat. Not to say that the meat was abundant. The pork was flavorless and dry (no sauce served on the table) and overpowered by the enormous piece of bread it is served on. The chicken was just okay, until I bit into a bone. The brisket was the best of the lot (as it should be for Texas BBQ) but again, it was not as juicy as it should have been. At least it had some sauce on it. The menu said each sandwich was served with half sour pickles. Well each one in our group came with a sad little slice that was roughly the size of one McDonald's french fry. Big disappointment, especially for the $11-14 price tags on the sandwiches. The chips were pretty good, especially because they helped bulk up what was not exactly a heaping portion.

He continued to do this even after we completed the paperwork, shared insurance from her job, and have the same last name. This was quite insulting. Then, during my exam, I was pushed to be ""sedated"" for future  procedures even though I explained that I didn't want anything as I'm in recovery and it's a dangerous zone to feel drunk from nitrious oxide as well as the fact that I have no business taking most anti-anxiety medications. Then when asked if I grind my teeth, I told the hygienist that I clench at night to which she responded, ""why do you clench?"" Not sure how I should have answered that, but I just always have. When my wife had her consultation/exam, the Dr. Gutu was rude and condescending. She was poking around at my wife's gums during the exam and my poor wife flinched suddenly. Dr. Gutu rudely said to her, ""If you are flinching like that now, what's going to happen during your deep cleaning?"" We were both sent along with long treatment plans.

I have walked out of the paint department because no one will help me, the young clerk was too busy on his phone to help me, and a repairman checking the paint mixing machines would not make eye contact, so I left a huge cart full of items and several hundred dollars of purchases and went to Orchard Supply Hardware. This week we HAD to go and it was every bit as bad as before. When checking out with plywood, lumber, spackling, flowers, and other items, the check out girl could barely look up from texting on her phone and sent us out the door only to be told to come back in because she had not even rung up the items on the other side of the cart. It took us a good 10 minutes to catch the attention of the electrical supply clerk who wordlessly metered out the coiled electrical stuff we needed  without so much as a greeting or a word, even though we helped him manage the heavy rolls and tried to engage him.

Its quiet, and its close to my house for a quick afternoon cup of coffee. It was a typical meeting place for my friends and I to hang out. But now I know I'll never be back. 

Last Friday I went to enjoy some coffee with a friend. My receipt printed and I signed the $4.32 total and added a $1.00 tip. Then, on Tuesday my card is declined at the gas station. I checked my bank account and it was negative because Portland Brew charged me over $10,000 for a cup of coffee. It was a random amount, not even close to the number my total came out to be. 

I called the store and tried three different numbers, but none of them were answered after quite a few tries. I had to leave work and drive down to the store. 

Management was very nonchalant about the matter. Saying ""oh we're sorry about that."" Don't I atleast deserve ""Oh..we are VERY sorry about that.""? They acted like it was no big deal to them. I'm a poor college student unfortunately, so having all of my checks that I wrote for bills bounce was slightly stressful. So long to my perfect credit with all of the utility companies. :(

Luckily my boss LOVES dealing with legal matters and is handling the situation. I'm awful with confrontation and just want all my money back (including my numerous returned check fees). Now I have no cash for a few days until it gets resolved. boo.

I understand people make mistakes, but when they make big ones, they should be much more apologetic and quick to fix the problem.

The owner was extremely apologetic and has a much better attitude than the manager. Atleast I know the Portland Brew organization is not a complete mess.",2010-11-09 21:43:50

LOCATION: Nothing amazing - totally dead on weeknights. I wouldn't recommend eating there - I'd take it to go or have it delivered. Last time I was there waiting on a to-go order, they blew a fuse and half the restaurant's lights went out.

FOOD: I wasn't in a pizza or pasta mood, and instead ordered a Buffalo Chicken Salad. The salad turned out to be pretty good, actually!

The prices are a little higher than other Thai places, but a couple of dollars per entree won't break a budget. Last night was probably a really off night for them because I heard the chef and all the servers yakking away in the kitchen while they prepared our meals. It was my boyfriend's first visit to Erawan and I talked it up a little. We ordered the Ocean Seafood special and Crispy Duckling in red curry. The Ocean Seafood special had a nice blend of salmon, scallops, big shrimp, medium shrimp, oysters, and squid in a spicy thai basil sauce. The Crispy Duckling, unfortunately, was DRY. It is possibly the worst excuse for duck I have ever eaten in my life. When our server arrived and asked us how everything was, I told her it was dry and she pretended not to understand what I said.

When my husband and I stopped by for a late dinner on a recent Saturday night, we were excited that there was a restaurant open late in the Brandon/Riverview area with a pretty well rounded beer/beverage/food menu.  When we arrived, we were seated quickly despite the place being fairly crowded, and it seemed like we were going to have a nice, relaxing late meal with some music playing and basketball on the multiple flat-screen tv's as pleasant background filler.

However, I wish we had done a bit of research or been warned by the hostess that the entire place turns into ""Club Cougar Den"" after 10 p.m.  If you're over 40, single, and looking to hook up in Brandon, this is the place to visit for fresh prey.  If you're under 40 and too lazy to do your hair and makeup to go out in Tampa, this is the place to visit for attention.  Unfortunately, we didn't fit into any of these categories.  The dj's music choices were schizophrenic, to say the least.  The house/pop/metal remixes played at max volume were too much to take during dinner, and made conversation or communicating with the wait staff impossible.

The food and drinks really saved the experience for us though.  The menu is bar food, but more innovative and better tasting than average with cheap prices.  Despite being part of a chain of restaurants, we found the menu more innovative fare than your typical box restaurant.  We got out with a check under $40 for two, including drinks, an appetizer, two entrees, and the tip.  We will definitely return, but will go a little earlier and sit on the patio.

I would suggest that if the Green Iguana wants to add anything else to the circus it calls Saturday night entertainment, management should replace the bouncers with drag queens and go-go dancers.

(Btw he was there the whole time we were they helping other people but not us, very rude and unprofessional) So then we asked someone else they finally took our order... however it took about 1 hour and multiple visits to a manager to ever get our drinks. Oh and remember the food we we had to order to reserve our lanes that were promised to us at 8... well those never showed up.

They cut hair here but this is not a barber shop.  The first tip that the vibe here is about them, not the customer, is that they were playing women's daytime television.  There were two men there before me, this place is about, get in, pay, get out.

I used to get haircuts in Nashville but my barber moved; most of the barbers I've ever known looked at their craft as a skilled trade they take seriously.  Like a really good mechanic, you can tell a lot about them by how they keep their tools and workspace.

The basic full clipper cut quality was a 5 of ten with no attention to detail.  Though there was no one waiting, the cut was rushed.

Most significant reason to not go back is that the final neck clippers were either dull or not aligned properly and they micro cut my neck about five times.  I had contact whelps all over my neck for 48 hours.  To use clippers that actually nick people makes you wonder if they disinfect between clients.

So I should know that any place that advertises as being both Japanese and Chinese should send out red flags.  It's like having two professional degrees....you end up being mediocre at both.

Overpriced for what it is.  The rice is sticky and mealy, which makes eating raw fish on top of it unpleasant.  They did have fast service which is a minor plus.

The quality of the fish was so-so.  My unagi was nice (but I think I've never had bad eel at any sushi restaurant), but my spicy tuna roll was just plain gross.  You know how some places use the tuna scraps to make a diced tuna roll instead of solid pieces of tuna?  This is what you get here.

In late June, I made a reservation for 2 rooms for a wedding I was attending in the area on August 15th. The same day (or very next day) I called to cancel these reservations because our first choice hotel became available. I have an email that I wrote to myself that day with my confirmation numbers as well as the cancellation numbers:

Confirmation number 67338301
Cancelation 52661698

Confirmation number 67338299
Cancelation 52661698

Turns out the cancelation number was the same and the person I had spoken to had only canceled 1 room! I only recently discovered this mistake while doing my taxes and called to clear it up.

I received quite a bit of pushback on this from the Hotel itself so I called a customer service number. The woman I spoke to was more understanding and agreed to refund my cancellation. She gave me a confirmation number and said my account would be credited within a few days.

That was 10 days ago.

I just called again to check up on things only to discover they changed their minds about giving me a refund! Nothing I could say would sway them.

Maybe I've been lucky, but this is the very first time I've been wrongly billed for anything that wasn't cleared up with a phone call. I guess I just trust that companies might think twice before stealing a quick $175 off a customer especially in this age where it's so easy for me to share my experience.

This might be a fine hotel, but honestly I'm not sure I'd ever stay at a Holiday Inn Express ever again after this. There are so many better options that haven't treated me like this.

Go to the Sheraton down the street. It's a nicer hotel anyway.",2016-03-08 18:00:52

I had a relative that went here for tire work and had much the same experience - slow to sub-par service.

A good tire technician can change/balance 4 tires in 45min to 1hr. That is doing some serious 'haul arse' work, but it is doable. If the four tires are larger truck tires, it may be a bit longer. In my experience, I have never taken 2+hrs to replace a full set of tires. Exceptions may be low-profile wheels/tires when the tires are like 'rubber bands' on the wheel and require more attention. Honestly, I would never bring a setup like that to Sears Auto, anyway.  Others are wheels that have pressure sensors as they all have to be removed one at a time and then reprogrammed after done. Regular rubber valve stems are just snapped off, and new ones popped back in. 

Single tire or two tires will take even less time. Single flat repairs can be done usually within 30min. 

Oil changes - Go elsewhere. The way they still work here, I have a hunch, oil changes are handed over to the advanced level technicians in the back shop to complete. Those guys typically do break jobs, shocks, struts, alignments, etc. More 'money' work and when they see the oil changes, they don't want to touch them ergo the jobs sit. Or, if it is part of other big job work, they do the big stuff then put the ticket back for someone else to complete the oil. Things may have changed and tire techs may be allowed to complete the oil changes, but looking at comments, it may be the same. Either that or the techs on both sides just don't care - also likely. Possibly including supervisory staff.

I no longer do tire work; have since moved to better employment, but I still long for my own tire changing equipment to do it myself. None of the places around here do the work as quickly or as detail-oriented as they should.",2016-05-15 19:56:53

Before you go, please understand that they do NOT have much inventory! We drove an hour after receiving one of their catalogues in the mail. The website clearly stated that if you book an appointment in advance, not only will you be guaranteed individual attention, you will also receive a 75.00 dollar credit toward your purchase. They also suggested looking at their inventory online and bringing the style number of the gowns you are interested in to save time. So, we did just that and I was happy to get an email the evening before to do a ""pre-check in"" in order to, once again, guarantee not only my personal service but also get my 75.00 dollar credit. So I pre check in and off we go with extremely high hopes and enthusiasm to see these beautiful dresses...........then we get there.
We arrived 15 minutes early and were told since we were 15 minutes early, no one was available to help us, however, we could go back and look at the dresses, we could select 3 dresses to try on and hopefully by that time, someone would be available. Really??? What about all of my registering, pre check in, email confirmations, text messages, all the run up and detail only to find that it is a first come, first serve operation. So finally a nice saleswoman does come by to help us and honestly she could not have been nicer. All of the employees seemed really nice, hence the one star. The problem was, not only did they not have ANY of the 3 dresses we came to see, we quickly learned that they were low on inventory and would charge you an additional 30.00 dollars if they had to order you a dress that they didn't have in stock. So in an attempt to sell us what they had, not what we really wanted, my poor daughter starts trying on gowns in colors she didn't want and over our price point. However, in the interest of staying positive and me wanting her to have a great senior prom shopping experience, I played along and we settled on a gown. It was 70.00 dollars over my max budget but I thought since I had a 75.00 credit, it would bring it into line; I was wrong. We get to the check out process and immediately see that they took this beautiful, expensive gown and removed it from their hanger and placed it on a cheap plastic hanger that looked like it was going to snap in half from the weight of the dress. Then, I see a cheap plastic garment bag hanging behind the counter with a 20.00 price tag on it. Hmmmmm. So the guy rings me up and quotes the full amount. I then tell him that there should be a 75.00 dollar discount, per their website. He then tells me that there isn't a 75.00 dollar credit, what there is, is a 50.00 credit for accessories, free garment bag valued at 20.00 dollars and a possible 5.00 dollar gift card if and only if you write a positive review on their site. This was so clearly false advertising that I am going to report it and I've attached the ad so you can see for yourselves. So, I told him I simply wasn't willing to pay that price when I was clearly mislead about the credit and we left. We sat in the car and re-grouped for a moment and not wanting to have wasted a day in south jersey, I decided to go to a store called Jay West in Haddonfield. Thank God I did! Not only did they have a much better selection, they were having a 20% off sale on prom gowns and much to my delight, my daughter's vision of her dream gown just happened to be hanging on a rack, on sale no less!!! We quickly tried it on, modeled it and purchased it! The saleswoman was so sweet and helpful and it's a beautiful store with great prices! I noticed that they carry some of the same brands as Jan's and much to my surprise, the very same gowns are lower priced than at Jan's!! So in many ways I owe Jan's a thank you for the low inventory and misleading advertising, we would have never gone to Jay West and found the dream gown, for much less money, had we not had such a terrible experience at Jan's! Bottom line: if you are looking for a beautiful gown and pleasant shopping experience and competitive pricing, drive right by Jan's, stay on Rt70 until the Haddonfield exit and save yourself the aggravation and drive directly to Jay West in Haddonfield! My price point was between 300-400.00 dollars. Jan's does not have inventory at that price point. They push dresses on you that are 450-700.00 just be warned!!! And good luck!And: Jay West doesn't charge for cheap, plastic garment bags (who does that?!?!) they provided a beautiful, dark pink cloth garment bag....free of charge!!!",2019-04-07 14:06:14

But at the same time when you are paying an average of $60 per person for dinner with wine I am thinking everything should be top notch. Yet none of us complained when the service definitely wasn't. Those of not involved in the tiff just wanted to move on. 
The drama between the server and one of our party really wrecked it. At one point he handed the order pad to one of the women with us and said why don't you just write it down? Can you say awkward.

The stupid thing is the majority of us had no part in what happened, didn't really want to be involved, just wished it would get dropped and yet were ""treated to this awful dinner theater between the server and one of our party"".

AFTER EVERYTHING I WENT THROUGH WITH THEM, THEY SUED ME.  YES THAT'S RIGHT!  I TRIED TO EXPLAIN FOR OVER A YEAR THAT DUE TO THE UNETHICAL AND UNDER INDUSTRY STANDARDS JOB, LEAVING A SOAKED FLOOR OF MOLD IN MY HOUSE THAT I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THEM THE INITIAL AMOUNT, THEY HAD DEMANDED TO START THE JOB AND ALL THAT WENT DOWN...INSTEAD OF BEING AN ETHICAL COMPANY THEY SUED ME.  YES THEY LOST BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE WRONG, BUT THEY PUT ME THROUGH HELL FOR YEARS.  

OH AND THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TO COURT FAIRLY OFTEN...WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?  

IF YOU DO NOT TAKE MY ADVICE AND USE THEM ANYWAY, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THEY ARE DOING THE JOB RIGHT!  OTHERWISE YOU WILL END UP WITH MOLD ON, IN MY CASE THE FLOORS AND THEY WILL COVER OVER IT AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW TELL YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE STARTS GETTING SICK FOR UNKNOWN REASONS!  I AM TELLING YOU THIS TO BE AWARE.

Steer clear from this company!  They are contracted with AAA which is my insurance company. My dishwasher leaked and damaged my floor and my cabinets.  Initially when we set up the appointment they were very charming and nice...however, their first order of business was mold remediation and they failed miserably in doing the job!

The main issue was that they not only did not properly remideate the mold but they sent a guy who told me he had only been on the job for 2 weeks and left him alone on the job...they claimed to AAA they had completed the job but the floor was soaking wet.  I contacted AAA said, I don't think this job was done properly and asked them if I could get another company to inspect it.  When they showed up they asked me, what did they do?  Long story short the job had to be done by another company who properly did the job.  My advice is when it comes to your home NEVER use a preferred provider of AAA!  I thought it would be the fastest easiest way to get the job done right but it was not!  It was/is a nightmare!

Bottom line, if I had not been on site to witness what was going on cleanrite buildrite which I now call clean wrong build wrong would have covered up the mold with flooring and I would never had known.  I wonder how many homeowners have used this company and how many have been bamboozaled into believing the job got done to industry standards!?

Not only that their ""manager"" tai, was a bully and used that as leverage against me.  In the end, I just wanted the job done right...and that is what I got when TAHOE MOLD AND WATER came to my rescue.

I was so surprised and it was going to be the best night I have had in a long time, I was extremely sick for over 1  1/2 prior so it was kind of a celebration. I was getting well & together with all of my family and dear friends. As usual my wife was extremely clear and cautious about my daughter's food allergies prior to that evening so they could be prepared but that night she took her 1st bite of her appetizer she started having a severe reaction to the food. She is allergic to milk and eggs and shellfish, so we have been helping her deal with this allergy for 18 years now and understand clearly those types of accidents are going to happen from time to time. Just own it and say you're sorry and we go home and move on. For some reason this manager insisted that there was nothing wrong with her food and was insulted in a weird way she implied as if we were making this up or something because nothing could ever be wrong with her food when in fact my daughter needed Benadryl immediately than went home with my niece and was vomiting for an hour or so with hives. Normally we would have gone home with her but we had a lot of guests and that was not an option. The shocking part was that night the management team continued throughout the evening as if nothing was wrong or nothing ever happened besides our waiter, He was clearly concerned. But Management acted as if nothing ever happened or it was no big deal. We all felt awful for her, We had spent a lot of money for a nice night and a careless chef did not do his or her job than they still charged me for my daughters meal this was the end I was crazy mad she only had one bite. My wife asked me to hold it in we had guests but a few days later I called back after I cooled off and they did a little research and told me they are sorry there was egg on my daughter's appetizer. I was outraged, that manager and chef should have both been fired for implying she was lying. To not stop by my table at any point to see how she was doing at home was just unbelievable. Not once did anyone of his or her kitchen staff asks if she was OK neither did the manager. In a measure of good faith after I called them back and explained that this was unacceptable they decided to send me a $50 gift card that I though away. I was not going to review them but I can't let this one go. They need to understand that the customer is always correct and they can make them or break them and if I was that owner I would have bought desert and apologized to no end. My god how embarrassing is that. I also would have sent the child something possible a card to say we are sorry, No call no card no concerns, All the way to the end that night they denied it as if we made it up. To this day no one has apologized to my daughter and we are certainly not looking for one now. Look accidents happen just man up and deal with it never insult your customer because you will lose them and their 40 guests. Sad part is the food is good just awful management team.",2015-04-02 16:54:39

When we asked about our order we were told the kitchen was backed up - doesn't make sense when people coming in after us got their food.

We did order a couple more beers (for our hour wait) for which I tipped zero. I hate to do that but combined with my earlier 20% tip the bar staff is still at 15%.  Way more than was warranted.

Manager brought them back out and said to the wife ""...i think this one's your's...""   Immediately i had a WTF moment.  We tried them, they sucked, sent them back and was done w/them.

The jewelry cases are nicely lit and it offer nice ambiance. However, my experience did not match up with what I imagined was a high end shop. 

I walked into this shop simply to purchase  a new nose stud after I accidentally threw my original 15 year old piece away. I chose STTP for the overall rating. Upon arriving, there were a few people already inside. I had to get in line to sign up for an appointment to select a new piece of jewelry. I thought it was a little odd since all I needed was a new stud. My piercing is 15 years old, so I didn't imagine I'd need help putting a new one in. Anyway, they said it was free to put it in so I accepted their offer. While we waited, more and more people piled into the shop. While I very much appreciate that they have contactless payment set-up, there were no physical distancing measures in place. I waited approximately 20-25 minutes and for me, it was uncomfortable to see so many people inside the shop. 

When it came to selecting my new nose stud, I was underwhelmed by their selection. I have sensitive skin so surgical steel is the best option for me. Studs are $15.00 and nothing special.  After selecting the new piece they took it to the back to get cleaned and I was directed to little space in the back that seemed sufficiently sterile. 

The staff member who put my new stud in had sterile equipment that was still in it's packaging. The only thing that was skipped over was prepping my skin with an alcohol wipe to at least clean off the area. But I didn't give it too much thought since in my 15 years of having a nose stud I had never gotten an infection.  Putting the new piece of jewelry was as painful as the day I got my nose pierced. There was a lot of pressure and I felt a ""pop"" on my cartilage. This made me very nervous and I expressed that to the employee.  I only waited 4 days to replace the stud I had thrown out so there is no way a 15 year old piercing would have needed any form of re-piercing. 

Needless to say, I ended up with an infection- pus, redness, pain. I called the shop on Monday morning but they were closed, so I followed up with a DM on Instagram. No one ever replied to me. I ended up treating the infection with antibiotics. A week later it's getting better. 

Personally, I will not recommend this shop to my friends and I don't plan on returning. One-star reviews are the last thing I want to publish.

I originally felt bad for leaving a bad review but then I figured I'd feel worse for not warning others.


In short: DON'T GO HERE. WORSE RESTAURANT I EVER BEEN TO.


Their flier brags: ""We offer a variety of chinese, Japanese, Italian and Mexican cuisines daily"". But they can't even get the chinese food right and the staff IS chinese. At the buffet table they have 1 piece of mexican food simply labelled ""taco"". growing up with a mexican family I can confirm it was NOT a taco. They have 2 ""italian"" pieces, garlic bread and cheese ""pizza"" haha ARE THESE GUYS SERIOUS!!? oh and by the way read below and you'll learn that the cheese pizza isn't actually a cheese pizza either.


Ok, I love chinese food. Especially orange chicken and rice so after hitting the morning buffet I immediately got some orange chicken, rice and chow mein. Let me say not only was it the worse orange chicken ever, it was BAD almost torture bad. It was watered down like soup, it lacked flavor it was actually hard to eat which is saying a lot from a person who's favorite food is orange chicken. I wanted to throw the whole plate away, the rice was the worse rice I've ever had and the chow mein was the worse I've ever had!! I swear this has never happened before where all items on a single plate are the worse I ever had.

Being optimistic I gave a second plate a try, except I was more cautious this time. I tried one of almost everything, 1 tofu, 1 clam, 1 of other stuff i had never even eaten before.
.... It was ALL bad :( . I almost wondered if the food had been recycled, but it was 10:30 am!! I could describe it but let me cut it short by saying, it lacked flavor tasted stale and was not enjoyable in any way or form, again it was close torture!!

I was full but pissed off so I decided to get another plate to hopefully justify my money but I decided to get the usual ""american"" stuff and figured ""fries can't be ruined right?""

Well I got fries which were labeled fries but were more like potato wedges, which is not a bad thing, I got onion rings, a stale cheese pizza that everyone ignored, some chicken wings and a piece of garlic bread. I'm fat right? But I HAD TO after being ripped off.

I got my last plate with a side of ketchup and you know what? Even THAT food was bad!! But it was the best plate of the three!
The ""fries"" were decent but didn't taste fresh, the onion rings were ok but not as good as Burger King's or any other fast food restaurant, The Pizza was TERRIBLE!! tasted like they just got leftover ingredients and Frankensteined it together - I mean the sauce didn't even taste like pizza sauce and the cheese was probably a week old and the slice just tasted sweet and weird, like it was a strange experiment. The chicken wings were ok.

The Funny Part: The garlic bread was the best thing at the buffet and I tried almost everything!! It tasted like your usual frozen packaged bread but was NO WHERE NEAR as good as the cheap stuff you can buy at fry's. So it was bad but it was the best part lol

IN CONCLUSION: DONT GO HERE. IT WAS THE WORSE RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO. ALL THE FOOD TASTED STALE, LACKED FLAVOR, AND FELT LIKE YOU WERE EATING STRANGE EXPERIMENTS.",2012-08-26 20:13:05

I thought this new menu was a joke by the bartender, but was quickly faced with reality that this is all left to order.  They literally took scissors and cut out the appetizer section from the retired full menu.  Rebar Indy was a place to get some damn good food, well no more.  

We ended up having one more beer as we finished our cheese curds and fries and then decided that we were still hungry, so decided to go to a place around the corner with a full menu. 

Rebar Indy should update their website to actually say that they are just offering a very small appetizer section and not just saying they've ""launched a NEW MENU"".   Updating their Facebook page would be nice too, last update was 10-08-18 and shows some of those now dead full menu items.

And so, like a teenage love fling, my foodession with Arch Rock Fish ends in disaster. With over 48 dining experiences at this once favorite eatery, the break up comes with utter disappointment. Yes, I loved their Parmesan Truffle Tator Tots, Fried Calamari, Mussels, Cioppino, Seafood Salad and of course, Mom's Apple Pie, however, that alone cannot keep a frequent diner and hungry eater satisfied for long. Pair the food with the atrocious customer service that it is often served with and you'll leave with a very bad taste in your mouth. 

There have been some major changes in staff, with some of the best leaving to work at other establishments: Randy, their star bartender in my opinion: Shannon the best waitress by far; and Kyle, the type of manager that took the time to get to know his  guests by name and ensure food and service were up to par. What is left in their wake is an operational nightmare that seems to start all the way at the top, poorly trained staff, lack of communication amongst management, and overall lack of professionalism. 

I have held a couple of events here since their opening and both were flawed. The staff that were assigned to work our parties were not informed of specific details despite ample communication on our end, the event ""manager"" was very inefficient in returning calls and emails, on the day of one event in particular, the staff had to call a former employee (Randy, who I mentioned above) to get instructions on how to work the A/V equipment. Ahhh! 

Arch Rock is best for their happy hour and even that is not that great compared to places like Finch & Fork, Tupelo Junction, Blush, The Bourbon Room and FisHouse. Stick with the beer and well cocktails if you dare venture there for HH. The house red wine they serve would not be worth it even if it was free. 

I agree with Justin R., do not order the burger, unless you're looking for a beef jerky like texture amidst your bun. Do try the tuna sandwich. It is good. 

If you're visiting, love seafood and want the quintessential Santa Barbara experience, there are far better restaurants to try before this one. If all of your eggs are in this basket, you'll likely be disappointed. I would recommend Seagrass, Brophy Bros, Arigatos, Finch & Fork, or Pace just to name a few. For other great SB Happy Hours, check out my list. 

So here's my breakdown,

Food: 3-4 stars
Customer service: 2 stars
Management/Operations: 1 star
Beverage: 2 stars

I was REAR-ENDED inside the car wash!!! The lady who hit me had to blow on her horn to get the staff to realize they needed to shut off the washer.  When I got outside, the employee immediately told me MILES wasn't liable for damage (""there is a sign out front that tells customers they are liable for all damage""). He also told me it was all MY fault for having had my car in park (ironically, I had put the car in neutral, as he had instructed, right before I was hit). When trying to exit the tunnel, it was obvious that my tires had not been well-threaded into the machine- yes, the employees are the ones who guide you to do this at the beginning of the wash. I had to maneuver my car tires quite a bit (with the assistance of an employee outside of the car) to get out of the tunnel when my wash was done.

Obviously, the wash tunnel is poorly supervised. We complained via phone and email. Never got a return call but received an email in which MILES still insisted it was not at fault. Disappointingly, the email was full of half truths. Given the company's reaction (carefully scripted email and immediate proclamation of innocence, we realized that this has likely happened before. We had minimal damage, but MILES' admission of fault would set a precedent, wouldn't it? Exactly why I think this has happened before.

After a few weeks of this, I get an email informing me that they are closing my claim because they didn't get my dog's medical records. When I called and emailed them screenshots of all the times my vet had sent across the records (with their email address highlighted so they couldn't come up with some new lie) they then magically managed to find the records. Days went by and finally after almost 2 months of incessant calling/emailing I finally received my claim. 

- on 25th of November I took my dog to the vet for a cough (pre-existing condition). when we were there the doctor suspected that Xavier had air in his oesophagus given that he was regurgitating food as well as coughing up phlegm. They suggested we do an X-ray to get a clearer picture. on the 16th of December Xavier got attacked by a bull mastiff and had a huge, gaping bite wound on his thigh. When I took him to the vet, they found another bite on his as well, and the doctor once again suggested that its about time Xavier get an x-ray, to rule out any other internal wound from the bite as well figure out why he is regurgitating food (different from his coughing which was treated with antibiotics because it was kennel cough). We allowed them to do an X-ray and filed a claim with Pets Best (*cough* Pets Worst). 

The company rejected the claim in 2 days on account of a pre-existing condition. So I guess his dog wound was a pre-existing condition, any injury from that dog wound was also a pre-existing condition, and his regurgitating of food which was first suspected on the 25th of November (more than 2 months after we bought his insurance) was ALSO a pre-existing condition. 

Please stay away from this company. If you are looking for pet insurance, please look into Trupanion (my friends are thrilled with their customer service). I have moved to Embrace pet insurance as they make a distinction between curable and incurable pre-existing conditions. That means that if my pet goes 1 year without a cough and did not need treatment for a cough then its gets off his ""pre-existing condition list"". To give some context, my dog was a ball of nerves when we got him from the kennel and was puking, coughing, and had diarrhea. All of these conditions resolved within days of us having him, once he started getting comfortable staying in an apartment. We know this because all his problems disappeared once he actually started voluntarily walking out of the bedroom and exploring the apartment. But Pets best claims that his cough is now a pre-existing condition. They also claim that a cough and regurgitating of food are both one and the same thing. Kind of like a car and a building are the exact same things. 

So pets best has taken full advantage of the situation and has claimed that literally everything happening to my dog now: the internal injury resulting from a dog bite for example is a pre-existing respiratory condition. 

Reading other reviews here I can see that this is not the first time pets best is doing this. Please pay heed to these reviews and stay away from this company.",2018-12-30 22:20:16

I ordered AYCE, I'll break it down course by course.

Drinks- You get one drink the entire time, the servers may need a map to find tables that aren't at the bar? Not sure. Over an hour to get a drink refill which required hounding down a server.

Appetizers- These actually came out on time, the mussels are actually very good as well as the gyoza and vegetables

Sushi- I primarily eat rolls and ordered 8. Of those 8 I received 6, of those 6 one was not what I ordered, and two were missing ingredients. The three I wanted and got complete were actually very good.

We felt like we were in a Saturday Night Live skit that was making fun of upscale restaurants and celebrity chefs. We asked the waiter what ""hand cut"" meant in the salmon tartare description and his explanation was so nonsensical (""it is cut, by hand, by the chef hand, not by machine..."" as opposed to what or whom, I have no idea) that we finally put him out of his misery and said ""ok""--but then the tartare came and it tasted just like the knife it was ""hand cut"" with--heavy metallic taste that completely took over the fish. The Romaine in Garlic Vinaigrette was--and I am not kidding--5 whole romaine leaves dipped in white vinegar with a single chive on each one. Not a speck of garlic (actual or even flavor) anywhere. It was vinegar, not vinaigrette. Crazy. And it would have been really funny if it had been an intentional joke or if it had not been at a restaurant by Eric Ripert. I asked for salt, pepper and grated parmesan but I wanted to ask for anchovies, egg yolk, lemon and a hand blender so I could have turned it into something worth paying for. The trout in hazelnut brown butter had, literally, one hazelnut on it (split in half, no less!!) and the butter was neither brown nor flavored--it was bland. The bok choy beneath the trout was a soggy mess. And the taglietelle pomodoro with fresh mozzarella was underwhelming but also odd since the cheese was so cold that the pasta quickly followed suit.

So here's the dilemma.  The gumbo was just ok.  Plenty of fresh seafood, but it lacked a true Louisiana-style roux, which seems kinda crucial to gumbo to me.  It also was a bit bland.  So if you are a local gumbo enthusiast, I think you will be disappointed, but if you ain't from the South, you'll probably think it's good.  

The rest of the food that our party ordered was very good.  My son had a shrimp po-boy which was huge and delicious.  My husband loved his crawfish étouffée, and the boudin balls were the best I've had.  The fried green tomatoes were also a bit bland, but we swabbed them with the boudin ball sauce, and they were good.

I see other Yelpers commenting on the great service.  Maybe it was an off day for her, but our waitress was not great.  We had to ask twice (both before and after the meal) to split our ticket just two ways, and she acted put out.  Really?  What party of 4 adults isn't going to split their ticket?  I personally reviewed with her what went on ours, and she still got it wrong.  We settled that amongst ourselves.  She never offered to refill my tea.  And when she brought the ticket, it had 18% gratuity already added without comment for only 5 meals.  My friend had to remind her twice to bring the 2 to-go desserts she bought.  And when I handed her a $100 bill for our incorrect $57 ticket (with added gratuity), she said ""Thanks!"" and started to walk away, as if I would not be expecting change, which I then awkwardly asked for. 

So to break down my rating:
Atmosphere: meh.  2 stars.  It's a hole in the wall, but who cares.  
Service: kinda crappy.  1 star.  
Food minus gumbo: 4 stars.
Gumbo: 3 stars.  
Price: Yikes. A bit much for lunch in a hole in the wall place.  Once I paid my friend for our third meal on her ticket, I had spent $72 for 3 meals, two glasses of tea, and one app.  Better food in Metairie for that kind of money, and definitely better food in NOLA for that.  1 star.

We wanted to put it behind us. So, after that atrocity we were excited to switch from the hotel in walking distance to the stadium to our usual style hotel. My husband was on a business call as we walked in the lobby and, being a business owner, couldn't ignore the call. We were standing in line to check-in; they hadn't even addressed our existence, yet. But they made us feel like we couldn't use our cell phones inside their lobby. We were disappointed the spa and restaurant were closed- we always book at least 1 hour massages each with the hotel we stay with. Even more frustrating was not being able to just order room service after the horrible night Nissan Stadium put us through. And then to learn that our mini fridge was locked and, after calling the front desk, being told we were not ""allowed"" access to it and there were no waters in our room. Still trying to make the best of our trip, we changed and set out to make our dinner reservations. But when we returned, I wanted to get a better look at the lobby's architecture. Having a photography and studio business, being an Interior Design major, and having studied Italian Renaissance Architecture in Italy, I always photograph our hotel lobby. I snapped a few photos before we were approached by assumedly the female manager on duty the night of Sunday, August 1st. Despite my wearing a dress to dinner, I was in fact in cowgirl boots. However, my $350 boots were apparently not acceptable to her. She asked if she could help us with anything. And when I excitedly told her I was admiring the architecture and history of the very room we were standing in, she smugly smiled. At which point she asked, ""Are you staying with us?"" Feeling pressured, I explained we had been watching the video in our room earlier about the historic passing of the 19th Amendment in that very spot. (The irony of being judged as a female by a female.) And at that moment I realized her intention was not at all to attentively help her customers, but to kick out what she must consider to be ""riff-raff stragglers from Broadway."" And which is, proudly, the whole heart of Nashville. We dismissed ourselves to our room. At check out, we again felt on surveillance by ""the suits"" in the lobby. Walking outside, the valet asked us what we were driving. We said an Infiniti. He asked, ""Sedan?"" as if we couldn't afford anything bigger. We said, ""No. SUV."" He said, ""Blue?"" I said. ""Yes!"" And then he said no, that was one of his regulars. I said, ""Light blue. Not navy."" At which time our car pulled up. He said, ""Oh! The smaller one!"" Getting more and more irritated I said, ""No. The medium one."" All the while thinking, ""What does it matter?"" I assume my Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt and cowgirl boots again offended and the staff care far too much about judging appearances. My husband tipped them well anyway and we left, never to return. We are bringing our daughter back for a week in December. However, we have booked at The Fairlane. I was not treated like this at the Prince De Galle in Paris or at the Francis-Marion in Charleston. You know back in the day of Patsy Cline and the judgmental stiffs of Nashville, Outlaws like Willie Nelson rebelled against the uppity attitude downtown Nashville gave off. But The Hermitage is stuck in its ways. Johnny Cash and Elvis certainly would not have appreciated that kind of behavior. So before you brag about the famous people you have had stay at your hotel, think of where they started. I will pull out my strand of pearls and Chanel when I wish. And wear Levi's and boots when I wish. And expect the same service regardless. What a blemish to the very personification of Nashville. Nashville is a rags to riches story. About the working man, starting a business and now owning 28 acres, like my husband. Well, ""Blame it all on my roots. I showed up in boots.""",2021-08-05 21:41:21

Positive: no dine-in due to the pandemic, so not crowded. The place was clean when walked in. 
My husband and I have been to an Indian place before, but we were with my best friend who told us what was good there. 

However, in this case, we didn't know what to order so we went there physically in the hope that the server could help us make our choices. First of all, we couldn't even tell her it's our first time and ask whether she recommended anything. We felt so rush; she just wanted to get our orders as if she was racing against the clock. We placed our order and explicitly say we wanted it spicy. 

I'm from the Caribbean, so I can handle the heat

The worse part of this stay is I felt like my room was so dirty.  The carpet was so filthy, I refused to walk barefoot on it.  Crunch and sticky, it was yuck, for lack of a better description.

I didn't sleep well because I could smell the previous person in the pillows.  And I get that this is a hotel, but across the board, Marriott standards have gone way down.

That's where this establishment shoots itself in the foot -- BIG TIME. Their customer service for takeout orders completely cancels out the deliciousness of their food (hence the two-star rating).

It started with three bad experiences related to wait time. Two of those three times I had ordered online, via Gokul's website. And when I or my husband arrived to pick up our order, we either had to wait over 15 minutes for the order or Gokul staff never received it at all, which caused a wait time of 40 minutes and resulted in a frustrated husband who gave up altogether on dinner that night. The third time I chose to call in because their website proved unreliable. But even then when I arrived to pick up my food, it was not ready. I complained to the woman behind the counter about the recurring issue. She was apologetic as well as argumentative, providing excuses for the delays. 

Lastly and most aggravating, the staff at Gokul on Page outright LIES to you, specifically when you request extra chutney in your takeout order. This has been our experience all the time and it is the very reason I'm writing this critical review. I now open my bag to verify they included extra chutney and have caught them in the lie again and again. My husband goes off their word only to be angry when he gets home. I simply cannot comprehend the reason for such a lie. If they want me to pay extra for my request, they should ask. But lying about 20 cents worth of chutney is reputational suicide!

I honestly felt kind of judged during my consult by Naomi, who told me that, to her, I was showing signs of PCOS based off of where I held my weight and my facial hair. She was asking me personal questions that put me a little off, and told me that I was pretty much better off seeing my primary/gyno to address my concerns as they may be linked to this condition - which I did. And then they showed me their 4-step skincare line, as if I could process what they were saying after they just told me I could have this horrific disorder. I just wish that they had trusted what I said about my concerns and did not put me into a panic about my health.

Both my gyno and primary basically laughed me out of their offices, saying there was absolutely no way I had PCOS and they had no idea why About Face would have thought that I had this condition. They felt really bad that this had happened to me. It was a lot of wasted time and effort on my and my doctors' parts.

About Face scared me into making all of these doctors' appointments and having bloodwork done just to find out what I knew already...I'm as healthy as ever - just fat and hairy, I guess!

I wrote this message to the owner on FB messenger He said he'll read it after he has his coffee. So maybe you yelpers want to read while having your coffee. 

The owner replied to me as on Facebook. Saying it sound like I was threatening.  Because I asked for a reply from  FB messenger to get refund because I was scared to go back to the cafe because they threaten to call NOPD over me eating a Carrot.  and  I question them politely about their no outside food policies. So I replied back to the owner.

Your worker threatened to call police, that was the only threat. If I went back to demanded a refund. I felt he would have called the cops on me. So I asked on FB not wanting to cause any trouble. Instead of helping other customers. He would have been dealing with a man demanding a refund or man getting arrested by NOPD. Sorry about the miss understanding.  knew I couldn't bring outside food. I thought half carrot was ok. Like someone pulling candy out a purse. They probably would ask them to leave also. I started snacking on carrots after quitting smoking for some reason. And wanted one with my muffin and tea. Your employee nicely told me no outside food and I question the policy because it was a carrot. He then told me to leave or he'll call police. That  hurts. 

 like weeks before when they made you pay a minimum of $4 when using a card in 2018, so I bought a prepaid refill. Shifts changed and the did not honor my refill. Accusing me of trying to steal a free refill. 

But this day 
Leading up to him kicking me out. 
1st he told me he couldn't find the hot tea binder and he lost it weeks ago. And all of those teas aren't available anyways. And  take what we got. Rudely. But I used the binder the day before. So he's lying or just being too lazy to look. Now I'm trying to figure out what's available. But I don't see the tea bags anywhere..he then tells me the 3 teas available ..it wasn't the one I got last time and I enjoyed that one, but ok

2nd he told me customers aren't allowed to put feet on coffee table or chairs. I understood the chair part. But coffee table threw me off a little. So I left a  simi rude message on Facebook messenger asking them to be nicer or I'm not tipping.  because he was enforcing policies on me that I've seen other customers do. Like putting your feet on the coffee table in front the car seat they use as a lovechair. I guess now you can't. I got into my feeling and felt singled out. And that when I wrote the FB Messenger. Someone told him I left the message. Now he has a grudge. Instead of trying to treat me nicer, he decide to be even more petty. Because he felt out all of The other a-holes barista that work there, he is the nicest. And it's an insult to see his service as crap.  He definitely felt some type of way.

3rd was the carrot. He ask me to leave because I was eating a carrot with my muffin and tea. And threatening to call police. Because I ask him was he really going make me go outside over a carrot. He didn't answer me. So I went outside finish my carrot then went back in to finish my muffin and tea. He came up to me and told me to get my stuff and leave or I'm calling police. Like I was the one with the problem. God forbid I question him about the no outside food policy. How dare me. 

The owner replied saying he'll read my FB message after he has his coffee. But he never did.

I was excited to try this place, as this popped up on my Foursquare as the new ""trending"" place...  Made reservation for restaurant week.. As excited as I was to come here, I was quickly disappointed by the time they sat us down... 

M husband and I were seated in this tiny table that made me felt like it was the ""extra"" table they needed to put up., while I glanced over and saw a few booths opened.. Waiters, waitresses that walked by were centimeters away from knocking into my elbow... It was just so uncomfortable.. Sat for another good 15mins, before I had to halt another waitress down, to track down MY waitress so i can PLACE MY ORDER... 
She finally decide to come over, no introduction, no ""hi, how are you doing"".. just a ""what can i get for you""... 

Ceviche - was completely bland.. Didn't get the whole ""fish, lime, etc"" feel.. 

Coconut/ Conch soup - WHERE'S MY CONCH??!?!?!?! It was sooo salty, no conch, and maybe a hint of coconut.

Brisket - Was the only thing that passed and deserve five stars.. Portions a bit small though.

Steak - they could've given me a bit of a bigger plate.. My fries were falling all off of my plate. I asked for medium rare, but it seemed like it was just medium... 

Plaintain and Cheese as the sides, wish we didn't get either... 

Pineapple Upside Down - good but again, so small~!!!!

Coconut custard - could've used more coconut flavor... 

Overall, I was not impressed AT ALL.. I was expecting to be ""wowed"" but got nothing close to it... 

Not sure if its worth another trip back.",2014-01-30 02:54:05

The pizza is good if you want a lighter slice so you don't need to take a nap after eating here. The ingredients used in the pizza are great. We have gotten the pepperoni, sausage and corn pizza types on our various visits and they were both great. The first time we went the mussels were great but they forgot the bread. The second time where was bread and some of the mussels were undercooked and had that awkward mineral taste that didn't pair well with the hot broth.

I was stunned when I noticed the falafel was not fried to order, or the tabbouleh was short on bulgur and lemon juice and definitely had no salt. The hummus was super chunky and granular. Not smooth, and creamy. The pita was cold and straight out of a bag. I give this place A for effort /commitment, and I really want these guys to succeed. I do. But they need to pick up their game.

I decided to try here today for lunch since it is on my work campus.  We arrived at the peak of lunch time, so I was expecting it to be a bit busy.  There was a line, but for a soup, salad, sandwich place I was expecting a quick turn around.  Sadly, I was grossly wrong!  We ordered around 12:20 and my food did not arrive until 12:48.  That is INSANE for a half soup/sandwich.  Additionally, they forgot to make my friends sandwich, so once we finally assumed that, we asked them and his sandwich arrived at about 12:55.  I got the Lobster Bisque which was the best part of my experience.  It was quite tasty.  This is the saving grace from a 1 star review.  My 4 cheese sandwich was a hot mess.  It was about 85% bread 15% cheese.  It had about as much flavor as a hobo's shoe.  Very disappointing.  My coworkers sandwich the Southwest Turkey had the same problem.  Way to much bread, and not enough substance within.  It is on par or maybe even a little worse than Subway.

All in all, this place seems very popular, but I don't see the appeal... but then again the largest fast food chain in the world is Subway, and I wouldn't even remotely consider eating there... 

I will give this place one more go at a later date to see if they can improve their flow of customers, and improve the quality of their portions. 

Hot tip for those who want to try this place though, is order online and carry it out.  No lunch is worth waiting almost half an hour for!",2014-02-20 19:26:26

But the kids who used to work here actually had work ethic and integrity and were working here as a first job to pay for parts on their first truck or a new gun.  Now that the democrats moved into the area, the kids who work here have a sense of entitlement and have extremely poor work ethic. Its not really Taco Bell's fault, it is the fault of the parents who raise teenagers with a lack of morals.

I had a hard time finishing the whole thing, which for a basic staple as this, is something I've never said before.

This place has 1 of the worst hosting setups I've ever seen. The hostess station was outside on a narrow sidewalk on a high traffic street. They did not offer customers the opportunity to wait inside at the bar. After being told the wait was 45 mins to an hour most potential customer left. Those that remained stood around on the narrow sidewalk, leaning on parked cars on a high traffic street. What made it worse was the rudeness and poor attitude of the hostesses but I guess standing outside in 85 degrees inhaling car fumes can make a person disagreeable. There was a couple who had been waiting an hour and was told it would be another 30 minutes. This led to a loud argument. Oh, did I mention the road rage incident over a parking spot or the homeless man harassing people?
There are a number of similar restaurants a short drive away. I opted to avoid the sidewalk chaos of Ms Tootsies and went to another restaurant. I had a 20 minute wait (inside) at the bar and didn't have to deal with an unpleasant hostess. No matter how good the food is, I would advise potential customers to avoid this place.

My good friend moved here about a month ago and I was visiting for the weekend, and we were really excited to check this spot out. However, this place did not meet our expectations due to the company and staff we were around. 

When we got there, it was a crowded room and the hostess let us know we could get our drinks at the bar and there was plenty of standing room all around the bar since seating was limited. We went over to the bar, where two gentlemen happened to be leaving and they offered us their seats. We were about to sit down and order our drinks, and a very rude man and his wife swipe our bar seats from us complaining that they've been standing for an hour, and that they'll be taking their seats. My friend and I aren't ones to get in an argument over something like that, but it was pretty crummy. Just rude patrons all around this place. Not the bar's fault, but still.

We opted out of beer and decided to get the house cocktails, which were delicious! However, the bartender that served me was incredibly rude. When I went up to get our second round, he looked at me, demanded to see my ID, while he already had my credit card on file. I told him he served me before and I was in the standing area the whole time, and he told me ""No, I didn't serve you"". I told him ""Yes, you did"" and went to go get my ID. Once I returned he told me he did make the mistake and apologized. However, he was impolite and condescending in his delivery and I don't care to be talked to in such a rude manner, especially when I'm paying a $40 tab for 4 small cocktail.

Last month I shipped seven glass bowls from this location. I Did the ""pack and ship guarantee"", and Four of them arrived shattered because of poor packaging. Luckily, I had bought the insurance and called the store to start a claim. The employee that I spoke to told me that I needed to ship back the broken glass to be investigated for the claim. I came out of pocket $69.20 to ship the broken glass which was promised to be refunded to me as part of the claim.  The manager Blake has been extremely helpful, and was able to get me the money back for the claim, except for the $69.20 to ship the broken glass. The owner is refusing to refund that money, because he is positive that his employee would have never told me to ship back the broken glass because that is not their policy. After spending Countless hours on the phone with UPS, the owner is still refusing to refund the money, because I guess He thinks this customer is trying to get one over on him. I'm not sure why he would think I would pay to ship broken glass on my own dime if somebody didn't tell me that. I guess the new trend in customer service is ""the customer is always wrong"". The owner told UPS corporate that it's not about the money- he eats dinners for more than $70, it's the fact that he is positive his employee didn't say that.

(We used the Westin in Memphis for my wedding guests and I stayed there on my wedding night.  MUCH nicer than this one.  The one in the suburbs of Richmond is also very nice)

Bill (one of the bellmen) was awesome and always friendly, so I wanted to give him a shout out.

The hotel is a typical Westin, but the shower drain was super slow.  My parents were put in the wrong room initially, (they reserved  a suite and were put in a king room).  They were relocated to the 14th floor which my dad referred to as ""the floor they put people on when they run out of rooms""  The suite was nice, kinda weird because it had stairs (yes, in the room, up to the living room and bedroom). My dad has ankle problems so I am sure he did not like that. He uses a cane, so you'd think that the front desk people would notice this and not put him in a room with stairs!  The hallway was covered in construction debris, I am really surprised they did not take time to vacuum or clean it up. The room across the hall from theirs was some mystery door with no number on it.  No clue what was behind that door.  

The elevators were very slow and broken often. I have seen this mentioned in other reviews.  4 elevators for 18 floors of rooms on a weekend is bad enough especially with one or two of them down.

Room service has a late night menu from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. that has a club sandwich on it.  When we called to order it we were told that it was no longer on the menu.  They need to update their menus to reflect this change.  and, how hard is it to make a sandwich? that was really disappointing.  My husband wanted food after the wedding we went to, so he made sure to call before 11 to get food of of the dinner menu.

The big river suite where we got ready was really nice.  it had 2 bathrooms and a big meeting room where we had our hair and makeup done. It also had an awesome view of the river and the oyster fest going on below.  That leads to my next comment.

The Valet staff was horrible when it came to parking the people that came do to our hair and makeup.  apparently, people were using all of the parking for oysterfest, and the valet staff did not make sure there were enough spots for vendors and guests for the wedding.  Several of us had go downstairs multiple times to ensure that all of The wedding guests would have a place to park.  

Also, valet took forever.  We called before we needed our car as instructed, and were told 12 minutes.  When we arrived, they had not even left to get our car.  They looked at my dad all puzzled and then grabbed the keys and left to get the car.  It took 30 minutes in all, and was a complete waste of time.  If they say 12 minutes, and you go down in 10 minutes, you should only have to wait a few minutes for your car.  Not 15 minutes in the humid new Orleans weather.  They did not apologize for taking forever either. Valet is super over priced at $18 with validation (i don't know where from, I wasn't driving) or $36 a day without it.  This is new Orleans, not new york!

Overall, a great time was had at the wedding itself and the ceremony and reception went fine.  I will not be staying at this hotel again if I have other options.  My husband has stayed at the W down the street and says it is a 100 times better than this Westin. Corporate should take a look at this franchise and make them make some improvements.

Hoping for a new and improved Buckley's, after months of being closed for renovations, you'd think you would be in store for something special.  Think again.

First off, service was terrible.  Our server didn't introduce themselves until necessary, and had to be tracked down twice during our meal.

The new menu is just not thought out well.  Not nearly as much to choose from before, and only a few selections in each category.  If you have a half dozen burger choices, shouldn't you have more entree choices?  I'd think so.

One of the kids got a flatbread pizza.  When one of the helpers brought it out, with the aid of a towel, he says ""careful the plate is hot"", drops it off in front of my young child and darts away.  If I wasn't mindful of this, no doubt my kid would have had a serious burn if he touched the plate.  Ridiculous what they are thinking here taking shortcuts by heating up plates to a thousand degrees.

I ordered the lamb shank for my entree.  What a mistake that was.  Looked like it was cooked the day before.  For $21.95, a meager portion, sitting atop of one, repeat, one disc of potato and three small cipollini onions.  Everyone's meals were average to forgettable.

I also noticed a Salmon entree on the menu.  I decided against that when I saw the table next to us receive their orders.  The portion was probably 4oz at best, and was charred so much it looked burnt halfway down.

Not a good feeling walking out of a place spending your hard earned money knowing you could have gotten Chinese take out three to four times over and it would have been better.

The Executive Chef needs a Gordon Ramsay lashing for getting away with serving this type of food.

Once I finally got in my room, there was a dirty Q-Tip in the bathroom trash can. I told myself that probably wasn't indicative of how clean the room really was, and tried not to think about it.

As for the hotel itself, it was super close to the airport, with a free shuttle to and from, so it's got that going for it. The rooms are kind of dated and tired looking, and could benefit from a refresh/update. Also, there are no full length mirrors in the rooms, which I found odd, considering they are all 2 room suites with plenty of wall and door space for a mirror.

The highlight of my stay? The excellent service we got from George...our waiter in the onsite St. James Restaurant. He was friendly, attentive and efficient.

The reason that I selected Virtua Voorhees was the fact that my Mother would be under Maro and Associates service, as she had been under their care since 1994 and was under another doctor and nurse practitioner in this practice. This hospital deserves NO stars. Dr. Maro loudly lectured me in my Mother's hospital room in her presence. He said that if something happened to her, he would not resuscitate her, even though a DNR was not signed. He went on to say that if she was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, she would never eat again, or it would be a stomach tube for feedings. I am sure that she could hear him as well as anyone else within earshot. He is loud and mouthy and totally lacks bedside manner. He had no respect or consideration for my Mother or me. I was frightened, and I am sure that she was frightened by hearing this, even if she could not express what she felt. I never saw Dr. Maro again, only his nurse practitioners and another doctor from that practice checked on her briefly. Sadly, after eleven days in the hospital a doctor from Virtua Garden State Pulmonary informed me that there was nothing more the hospital could do for my Mother and she was placed on a morphine drip by two uncompassionate and unprofessional fourth floor nurses, who are only there for a check. Hospice should have been put in place. I stayed with my Mother, as I did not want her to pass alone, it is a good thing that I stayed, as no staff checked in on us and she started  struggling to breathe, I had to go find a nurse.  After my Mother passed, I was able to obtain my Mother's medical report. The report stated that she was in the late stages of Dementia. I was not aware of this. Dr. Maro should have discussed this with me with finesse at some point of her hospitalization and explained what was happening to her. I should not have had to read it in a report. 

The report also contained a signed DNR by a Dr. John Birmingham, who is the definition of the word bully. The second day of her hospital stay, this doctor summoned me out to the hall and this is what he said referring to my Mother "" before she thinks that she can hear again. "" He insisted that I sign a DNR and obviously being the hospital savant, he told me my Mother would die. I did not sign anything under those circumstances, as I had Power of Attorney over my Mother's health.

My Mother also had an item of jewelry stolen from her, I filed a police report and Virtua's security would not co-operate with them. The hospital said that they were not responsible.
I sent my concerns about this hospital stay to Michael S. Kotzen, EVP of Population Health Management as well as NJ State Board of Medical Examiners and Medicare Quality of Care. 
I did not receive any satisfaction from the hospital or any of these agencies. I only received I am sorry letters.

This hospital is a complete disaster. My Mother lived with me for twenty years and was well taken care of by myself and her caregivers. The hospital staff failed her in lack of courtesy, consideration, respect and her dignity. She was not just any old sick patient, she was my Mother.",2016-06-21 17:44:05

I sent him a text about 10 minutes later expecting him to be done. He wasn't. He said that there were 2 women who were gabbing with 2 older women while they got their hair cut. So I said I would finish what I was doing and be on my way over. About 20 minutes go by and I shoot him another message. He was still not done. Now he said that even though they women working there had seen him, knew that he had checked in online, and had been sitting there for now 30 minutes, his name was nowhere to be found on the list.

So I drove over, picked him up and went to a barber shop In the area and got him a great haircut. it was worth the wait and extra money it cost to ensure that he not only got a good haircut, but was also treated like he was a paying customer.

Order:
 1: I ordered the Grilled Chicken Brest with bourbon glaze and French fries - Chicken was fair but nothing to write home about for sure. French fries; I ate 1 fry, it had a weird taste and cold, maybe it was cooked in oil that was sheared with other foods of something but in any case I didn't eat the fries.
 
2: Wife ordered the Chicken Wings and Onion Rings. I think there were 6 wings, she could only are 3 of them, she said they had a weird taste and didn't like them and normally she will eat the whole order of wing and other places. The onion rings she said weren't seasoned and were bland .

3: My friend ordered the Bone in Pork chops with bourbon glaze and bake potato. I took a couple of bites and again I think it was fair but to me it was overcooked and dry, I can do better on my grill at home 

Food overall in my option was that of the quality of dive bar food or really not even as good as some fast food places.

The establishment:
Very nice.  Looks like they invested a lot of thought and money in the place. Lots of outside eating space. Couldn't go up to the second floor outside deck as there was wedding party taking place up there, but i'm sure it was nice as well with a nice cityscape view.

Service: 
We sat outside on the lower deck. Waitress came quickly enough and drinks came in a reasonable time. Food took long time to arrive, maybe 35+ minutes and it was brought out by someone other than our waitress. We were never given any silverware, napkins or condiments, salt/pepper, ketchup etc. so we ask the guy that brought out the food for those items. A few minutes late our waitress brought out  silverware, napkins and ketchup but never any salt/pepper, I finely went in and grabbed those off a of one of table inside. 

Bar:
Fantastic selection of sprites and beers.  Me and the wife had the $4 bottled Miller Lites and my friend had a couple of different bourbons, something like the mid range stuff $12-15 for 3 fingers. 

Overall ,in my option if you want a place to go drink and you don't mind paying premium prices for your drinks this would be a cool place to hang out, but if your looking for GOOD food I would reconsider.

Service has always been average but the pedicure massage is always a highlight. They must have new staff but I don't plan on coming back. I had a female doing my pedicure today where previously I've had male staff. I don't know her name because no one was wearing name tags. I made an appointment and was able to walk straight back. When handed the sheet to select my pedicure I was planning to do the #2 for $38 but noticed there was lavender in the scrub which Im severely allergic to. So i asked if there was a substitute. She didn't understand me and just kept repeating the word lavender. Another customer asked her girl if she understood what I was saying. She did not. 3 people were asked and no one knew enough English to understand or help. So sadly I had to pick the basic pedicure even though I was looking forward to some of the features in the other option. But I didn't want to jump into the $40 range for today. 
I asked for my toenails to be cut down all the way. Which they weren't. Had to have her go back and cut more. They're still not at short as I'd like but it clearly wasn't worth asking again because she didn't understand.

I have a top of the line centrifugal juicer at home that I use as often as any other equipment in my kitchen.  A few times a year, if I'm feeling sluggish or gross from say, holiday overeating, I like to do a 5-7 day juice cleanse.  During those times, I've turned to companies like BluePrint or Pressed Juicery for delivery of cold pressed juices.  
However, wanting to support a local business this time, I went to Sip n Glo and ordered two of their Green Beasts as a part of my current cleanse.  I was pretty disappointed to find that (1) their juices are NOT cold-pressed, which means they are not so great for a cleanse (high speed juicing oxidizes the juice so that the juice degrades a lot faster, plus, you don't get as many nutrients from the juice); (2) despite NOT being cold pressed, the juices are PRICED like they are; (3) rather than juicing the lemon and ginger in real time with the greens/fruit, they use pre-juiced add-ins from bottles that are stored on the counter (so basically ""dead"" juice); (4)  they don't have parsley available, which is such a great source of nutrients during a juice cleanse and great for counterbalancing allergens.  Also, the juice itself was not to my taste -- the  lemon overwhelmed everything else and just killed my tastebuds.  

As I am perfectly capable of doing my own high speed centrifugal juicing at home,  I won't be back any time soon, especially when Whole Foods sells their own line of cold pressed juices across the street for less, and Pressed Juicery saves me a trip to the store by delivering a higher quality product to my door.",2015-01-15 18:07:47

After visiting in person early in the week to reserve a table for 10 people for drinks and desserts for the upcoming Saturday night, I was directed to email the event coordinator. I did, and received a response that on Saturdays for drinks and dessert, we'd have to do a walk-in and see what could be put together. I had gone a few weeks earlier for just cocktails as a walk-in with 8 girlfriends in the patio/garden.

My parents came in from New York, and I was excited to have them meet all of my friends for drinks. When we arrived, the entire front of the house was empty, save for 1 couple. The hostess (and later the manager) refused to seat us, citing many reservations. When asked if we could put 2-tops together, the hostess and the manager said they needed to be saved for walk-ins. (But weren't we also walk-ins?)

At one point, I sat down at an empty table to put down my drink and get my phone out of the bottom of my purse and I was promptly told to get up, as a reservation was coming in in 45 minutes.

So 10 of us stood about 3 deep at the bar for about an hour and a half, while 24 seats remained empty. We were then informed that only the OUTDOORS was for walk-ins and they didn't have a table for 12. When I suggested that we could split up into smaller groups (as we just wanted to sit down at that point), we were denied again. When I mentioned I had come before with 8 people, the manager sharply told me, ""Well obviously NOT on a Saturday night."" (At this point, there were even MORE empty tables)

Finally, after 2 hours of standing, we were seated outdoors and told that we were not allowed to order any food unless each person ordered a 3 course prix fixe dinner.

This situation was not just rude, it was downright hostile. My parents picked up the $300+ tab  without being ""allowed"" to sit or eat.

It was my parents' first time to New Orleans, and the Cane and Table staff absolutely ruined the visit. Both my parents and my friends (all of us 30+ years old who work in the legal, medical, and higher education fields) could not stop talking about the absurdity of the OVERT hostility -- as if we were being punished for spending money and bringing (what I assumed was) their target demographic into the establishment.

When we brought this to the attention of our waitress, she told us that mussels were in mating season and that was the reason for the smell.  It seems that perhaps one shouldn't serve a mussels dish during mating season.  To make matters worse, we told her to take it away (the smell was unbearable) and she charged us for it anyway.  This is no joke.

We have also found that when standing by the bar when it's busy, you get a bad smell from behind the bar every now and again -- we haven't been there at night in a while, but it seems like it must be related to moisture gathering under one of the rubber mats they have behind the bar.  

A dive bar typically has some charm to it -- you go in with certain expectations.  With Blue Dog, the way they position themselves as a family tavern, they really don't qualify as a dive bar and they really miss the mark on being a quality family tavern. With other really good bars in the area (like Capone's and Side Door) it seems pointless to spend your money in such a bad environment, no matter how stellar the beer selection (to be fair, the beer selection is generally very good).",2012-07-06 21:51:26

So what to my surprise when I arrive to enjoy a fried chicken dinner a few weeks ago, and was told you only have the buffet now until 9 or 10 p.m.... WHAT???? No ordering off the menu until that time? I don't know about you but I have no desire to eat that heavy at that time. So we left the cafe and went to the Ale House. We sat down and I thought, well I knew you had changed the menu to no longer have the fries (such a mistake), but I was in for my next big shock of the night....

We walked in, and it looked kind of quaint. Cute decor, only a few other patrons in the shop. No greeting or ""have you guys been here before?"" from the girl behind the counter, who seemed nice enough but clearly didn't care whether or not she was there at all. The cutesy little signs over the self-serve soft-serve machines bearing the flavors were obvious enough, so we grabbed a paper bowl each from the dispenser and made our choices. 

I went with cheesecake flavor, and added a few peanut butter cups and cookie dough bites. The boyfriend got dutch chocolate & salted caramel with pecans, peanut butter, and caramel sauce. We paid, and walked outside to enjoy the weather. 

My first bite was kind of shocking. It tasted bad, but I couldn't place why. I tasted it again, knocking away any mix-ins so I could make sure it was just the frozen yogurt that tasted so bad, and it was. I had my boyfriend try it, and he thought for a second and said, ""It's coconut."" I agreed that it definitely was (I can't stand coconut-flavored anything), and sat there kind of sadly for a minute before he suggested going back in the shop and asking about it. 

We went back in, and the girl from behind the counter had disappeared, replaced by a young guy sweeping the floor near the soft-serve wall. He half-ignored us until I directly asked him if the sign saying ""Cheesecake"" was correct, or if there was another flavor in the machine. He just shrugged at me and said ""No, it's cheesecake, but a lot of people think it tastes like coconut."" Then he went back to sweeping. 

We walked back outside and threw away both of our bowls without eating any more. The boyfriend said that neither of the two flavors he had were good either, lacking in any distinct flavor. We got back in the car and headed home to Mass Ave, where the new Sub Zero Ice Cream shop was more than happy to make us something good. 

Tonight's experience at Cultured Swirl was just annoying enough for me to never go back there. Coconut is one of those flavors that people either love or hate, so if you've got several customers reporting that one of your flavors actually tastes like coconut, you should at least put up a little mini-sign letting people know. The complete indifference of the staff wouldn't have been a dealbreaker by itself, but it was just another strike.

My meal was decent, but not outstanding, and surly not worth $10.  I will give them credit, everything is made fresh, no frozen tamale here, but my over all meal was bland.   My tamale taste like shredded cardboard served with a watered-down red sauce.  The poach eggs were cooked perfectly, but they forgot to top off the meal with Verdi Salsa, as advertised on menu.  I deducted one star just for leaving out a key ingredient, which probably would've made the whole meal taste better.  The Hash browns are homemade sauteed with green pepper and red onions. Delicious, accept they should pick out the bruise-blacken potatoes.     

The restaurant is small but adequate.  I love the chalk boards!  Obviously, there is a local company that makes up these elaborate chalk board menus, since you see them frequently around the city. 

My overall experience:

3 stars for quick service and friendly staff
2 stars for my meal, which would of been 3 stars if they had paid more attention to details, ie., Verdi sauce, avocado on the side. Those ingredients are there for a reason they are not a garnish, but to accentuate the flavors, in order to compliment the entire meal.

On top of that, she didn't bring my fruit plate and charged me for it and genuinely was uninterested in our table. I am not a fan of someone else delivering my food and our waitress never coming to check on us until it's more than halfway eaten.

I tried Shoprite's delivery service but they charge $15.00 for delivery and they never send a coupon for free delivery. Peapod sends coupons via email at least once a month. I usually never pay for delivery because of the coupons.

Unfortunately, their produce selection leaves a lot to be desired. I am convinced that they pick the worst possible produce in an effort to palm it off on their unsuspecting delivery customers.

I have had to call nearly every time about tomatoes that literally rot the next day on the counter and bananas that rot from the stem. I have NEVER had these problems when I pick up my own produce.

I ordered a head of lettuce and I was incredulous at the one they delivered. Honestly, I think it fit in the palm of my hand! I now ordered bagged romaine hearts so I know what I'm getting.

They are rarely on time, particularly when you use the discounted longer time window. Both times I used that they were at least 1 hour late. Extremely inconvenient to get groceries at 11 o'clock at night.

The icing on the cake was my last order. As the driver arrived, he announced that zucchini was out of stock. Zucchini in Pennsylvania in August was out of stock? How is this possible?

I will use them again for heavier items but I'm going to pick out my fruit and vegetables myself from now on. SMH.",2016-08-10 20:47:56

First of all I know no major beer drinker nor do I rarely even drink beer. Of course they have one but there one in the middle and not the best that you can get for the price that they're asking that's for sure!

I like the atmosphere, it is chill, cousin, and relaxing. I guess really can't get into something that's totally about beer more of a man's world than a woman's world and hey, that's an actual fact. A paragraph I wasn't impressed that they didn't serve any food. But I was glad to see that you can order food in and have something to eat if you were going to be there for an evening or several hours.

We ordered something and it was okay that will be in another review but um come but hey at least they offer that because they don't serve food and I appreciate that. What I don't appreciate is the fact that their wine selection is a little to nothing and the beer selection is very enticing.

I took off several years in my 20's, for health reasons, and because I didn't want to complete my degree until I had a firm grasp on what I wanted to choose as a career path. I eventually ended up in the area near Montco Community College. Some of the teachers were great. But, some were awful. More importantly, the staff in the offices are abhorant. They are lazy, incompetent, but worse, they are frauds. I was always great in math. When I came to this school, my algebra transferred over, but I wanted to refresh myself because I don't like being presumptuous and arrogant. So, I took beginner math, and then proceeded to take Mat100. I failed, both times. I have never failed math my entire life. I could see maybe getting a C, or even a D at worst, if I was just rusty after being away from it for several years. But, that is not the case at all. I didn't understand one thing in either class. All of the terms were completely foreign to me. I had never seen it in my entire life. I took tutoring, and I tried to take a second time, and still the same thing. Eventually, I started getting bullied, by several people living in the area, and a couple classmates, and after being there 2 years I left. I tried going to security to report it, and tried reporting the grades to anyone that would help remove the F's, but nobody gave a damn. That was approximately 7-8 years ago. I thought I'd give it a shot, and contact them about changing things. They told me they'd look into it. They said they'd remove the F's and make them W, which SHOULD have brought my GPA up from 3.33, closer to 3.8 at least. I was eligible for honors when I was there, which I didnt realize, because I was just so concerned with barely surviving these animals. So, after telling me they'd remove the F's, they claim my GPA stays the same. It's garbage. If you remove F's, then it should go back up. It doesn't take a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon to understand such basic common sense reasonable deduction notions. But I guess that's the point, I was doing good in math, and maybe they aren't so great in reasoning skills, so this is bitterness to impede others that actually work hard for something in life, and harm them because you clearly don't understand reasoning skills at all. So, not only did they rip me off and give me false classes in place of the classes which I should have received, and I worked hard to earn those classes fair and square, they destroyed my GPA, AND, they lied about fixing the problem when clearly it is still at square one.

Service: Wish I could give it 0 Stars

Back in the day, this buffet was a decent place to meet up with friends or family and eat your hearts out. We went with the same anticipation and found that this establishment has seriously gone down hill.

Food Selection: What selection? We went on a Friday night where they were serving all you can eat crab legs. In the past, the buffet also offered a plethora of selections that didn't look dry, sopped in butter, or half cooked. Not only was their buffet limited, but none of it looked appetizing. ""Fresh"" veggies and herbs looked wilted and brown while main courses were either dried up or swimming in butter. I was also disappointed in the quality of the crab legs which were smaller than I had remembered and still covered in what we think was sand. No thanks. 

Service: What service? We had a lady bring us our drinks when we arrived and that was it. During the 2.5 hours we dined there, we constantly cleaned our tables off, had to take our plates to the server's station (then got yelled at for clearing our own tables), and had to beg servers to bring us refills on our drinks.

It was extremely late, so I was expecting to just drop my keys in the box, but they were actually there so I walked in and talked to John and as I needed my brakes and rotors replaced as well, I told him to check those and any other items that were in poor shape that needed fixing.  John and I had a good conversation and I left feeling that my car was in great hands.  That would change from then on out though.

The next day, I called in afternoon to see if they had been able to take a look at my vehicle, so I could hear the damage (money owed).  I spoke with the manager and she told me that they would get it in that day, but I did not hear any feedback.  Then I called back the next morning and spoke to Josh and he told me they would get it in to take a look.  I received an email that day that said the receipt was attached, but it wasn't so I sent them a message and then on that next day they said they had never happened and finally they were able to send me a picture of the projected invoice to my phone.  The total was startling at about $3k, I'll admit I am not a car expert so I was not sure of whether this was an accurate amount.  I called in and spoke to John and asked what do I urgently need done and other than a loose door handle, he explained about everything was needing fixed ad he gave me some financing options to consider.  Unable to fathom paying a $3k car bill, I drove over and spoke to the manager again.  She was polite and I explained to her that with it being Christmas time, I would appreciate them going over the invoice again and deciding what needed done right now and what could wait as it would not affect my safety.  She understood and got my bill down to a much more reasonable $1200, if I would go buy an alternator at Auto Zone that they had priced to me half the price of their options.  Not only that, but she told me she would push to get it done that night or early the next morning.  I left that day, Friday, two days after dropping the car off with a new stream of optimism that everything was smooth sailing from there, but I was wrong.

I called the next early afternoon and spoke to Josh again and he said that he would call back shortly with an update, but that call never came.

They are closed on Sunday, so I knew I would not get a response until Monday, but I never got one, so I left them a voicemail and reminded them that they were running behind on their timeline and I wanted a call early Tuesday as the communication had been extremely poor to that point.

Josh called me on Tuesday afternoon and could tell that I was fired up about this poor communication and told me that it was just a series of unfortunate events: an emergency and the mechanic assigned to my car walked out.  Why I agree these are unfortunate, communication to let me know of these unfortunate events would have eased my mind, but I had to call and check regularly just to get any sort of communication.  Therefore I had Josh commit to me over the phone that it would be done that day.  It was done that day and I picked it up.  I have them my final concerns about the communication upon pickup which was followed by I should leave them a good yelp review and then talking about all the awards the have won for service.

Now talking to the guys at MyCarDoc, they seemed to be good guys and I feel that we could enjoy a beer together.  That being said, their communication was horrific and they refused to take accountability for their actions.  When it really boils down to it, most mechanics will do a satisfactory job fixing your cars ailments, so really it boils down to communication and service and they did not provide either to a satisfactory level, so that is why I am giving them two stars.  I on the other review of disappointment that they were sure to discount that yelper, but I reviewed this multiple times as I wanted to give you guys the facts.  At this point, I will no longer use MyCarDoc again unless the reach out to me to apologize for their poor service and try to make this right.  As I plan on living on the Northside of Indy for the rest of my life this $1200 exchange could have led to me being a $100,000 customer over the years, but now that money will be going elsewhere.",2016-12-28 02:21:33

We were all rather hungry by this time as over an hour had already elapsed. We tell her to go ahead and make a new pizza and don't forget the bread. 45 minutes later we get a new pizza with hardly any pepperoni, but it was circular and in one piece so it was at least edible. We open the small box to discover cinnasticks, NOT feta & spinach bread...and when we showed the driver the 1st pizza that was mutilated all she said was ""oh okay"" we called again and again no apology, this time they were even more rude, almost like I was bothering them because THEY messed up our order TWICE in one night now!

NOTE: Actually thought about ordering a bike from REI for return policy and dividends but decided to shop local.

I think they do so much business based on their location that there is no need to consider efforts in providing any type of customer service.  

I went in twice. First for a specific bike and was sold on another (more exp) bike.  Thought about it and went back to order the one the guy sold me on. Had to order it (bc I didn't like the color combo in stock) on 12/29 and was told wait two weeks for it to come in and be assembled.  Its been 17 days so I called to check in.  They told me that the manufacturer didn't have my color combo in stock and so nothing was sent to them.  

I highly doubt a large bike manufacturer ships an order of bikes and does not inform the shop that some of their order was not complete.  

When I spoke to the owner/man I ordered through he was not able to provide any clear story or options to purchase another bike. 

No one called to update me that my bike was not in stock or to give me options. Instead I waited for 17 days to have to seek them out to find out I was back at square one.  

No proactive customer service, no ownership in the lack of service and poor communication. 

They are always busy....location location location people.  Does wonders.  What a poor way to run your business.  

I called other bike shops to locate the bike I'm looking for...a few of them have told me they often get people in their shops that seek bikes or fixes after the bike room has not provided them the service desired. 


UPDATE - purchased my bike from flying fish bikes in S Tampa.  They were AMAZING and knew their stuff....and gave GREAT service.  They also said there is a lot of traffic and similar stories about 'the bike room' that they hear.

UPDATE - My Facebook review directing people to this yelp review was posted earlier this week.  There is a response to my FB review attempting to discount my experience and misses the point made above stating that this review is about a lack of service.  In the response it mentions the exact bike manufacture name.  I have not mentioned in any review the manufacturer name.  Clearly the response to my review was prompted by other motivations and is not an arms-length customer response to my experience but rather another example of the Bike Room not taking ownership of the poor experience I had.",2016-01-15 20:31:59

I have to say, I was really excited to try their Margherita pizza (my favorite), not to mention I love wood fired pizza, too.  I also ordered an order of calamari to enjoy after a very long week of work.

I'll start with the restaurant itself since I went to pick it up.  The place was tiny but very cute and romantic inside, and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by someone and asked how they could help me even though it was PACKED for dinner.  I didn't wait long for my meal and the girls I was chit-chatting with were very nice.  A+ for the brief service I got.

I'll start out by saying that the pizza was WAY smaller than I had expected.  No where on their menu did it indicate that this was basically slightly bigger than a personal sized pizza.  Had I known that, I would have probably ordered from somewhere else, considering the pizza was $13, OR at least ordered another entree type dish (it was dinner for 3 people).  That being said, it did smell amazing on my way home so I was still excited to try it.  The crust was delicious, however the middle was completely soggy.  Flavor was good, but I have had better.  For a wood fried pizza I thought I would get a deliciously crispy crust.  Plus.   All in all I don't think it was worth the price.  I'd give it a B at best (mostly because of the size to price ratio).  Not that it didn't taste good, but it was small, and it was soggy.

I also got an order of fried calamari.  This was awful.  It was so chewy that it actually disgusted me, and I'm not a picky eater.  I ate two pieces (the second was just to make sure I did really hate it before wasting my $8), and didn't touch the rest.  The  sauce that came with it was delicious and spicy, but I didnt even get to enjoy it because the calamari was so bad.  $8 wasted on this.  D.

Overall, for $23 I could have had a much better meal where I felt like I got my money's worth.   I've ordered from a lot of pizzeria's in Roxborough and this one just didn't live up to my expectations.  The pizza was ok, but also go in knowing that it is not by any means a large sized pie.

My husband and I decided to send our 3 year old son, who turned 3 in July, to Sonshine Preschool.  After we toured the facilities and met some of the staff, we felt very comfortable leaving our son in their care.  We thought sending him to a religious preschool would give him the foundation he would need to succeed in life.  We thought he would learn tolerance,patience and empathy through the learnings of Jesus Christ.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!  The one staff member we did not meet in the beginning was the Director, Jane.  I've heard this school was top notch until she took over as Director.

After 3 weeks of attending, twice a week at half a day, Jane pulled me into a meeting to let me know that my BARELY 3 year old son could not sit still during circle time, lacked attention, lacked impulse control, was disruptive and did not put his hands out when he would fall down (we have seen him put his hands out and his pediatrician assured us that his reflexes are fine).  Because of these characteristics, she and her staff decided he should be evaluated by Child Find through Washoe County for ADD.  She also asked that he leave the school as they could not handle him.  I couldn't believe it.  I was in total shock.  Up until this day, no one had ever spoken to me about any issues he was having.  Not to mention after being there for a grand total of 6 times, they had labeled him with ADD.  I was more than angry and tried to compose myself to the best of my abilities in the moment but I failed.  I am human, I do error and I was 7 months pregnant on top of it all.  I didn't curse or anything like that but I was hopping mad that this was the world we lived in now: that a BARELY three year old boy could be labeled with ADD.

After calming down and doing some research with my husband, we found that he was far too young for that diagnosis.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the soonest that diagnosis can be made is 4 years old.  Since leaving the preschool, we have had him to a therapist and she couldn't see what they were seeing.  She said a lot of what they were seeing wrong would fix itself with with maturity and that he would probably eventually outgrow it.  She also stated that he was too young for such a diagnosis.  We called his pediatrician as well and spoke to her at length and she also stated he was too young.  We did contact Child Find and filled out their paperwork but we have yet to have our evaluation date.  It takes a while since they work with the entire county.

The thing that bothered me the most, that I put together after the fact, was I had called the school the prior day to talk to his teacher about an incident my son had told me about between him and the co-teacher in the class.  He had told me that she pushed him and that he had hit her.  I had a long talk with my son about not hitting people but was a little disturbed they did not tell me about the incident.  When I called, I was assured that nothing had happened and in fact that co-teacher no longer worked there.  I really let it go in my head and was comfortable with the answer.  The very next day the director pulled me in to the aforementioned meeting and basically kicked my son out of preschool for being a high energy, intelligent little boy (at least that's how I perceived it).

My husband contacted Jane and her superiors through an email voicing our concerns, including the incident that supposedly didn't happen.  We received a response from Jane's superior, Tammy who did admit in the email that the co-teacher did pull our son's arm but not in an aggressive manner.  She assured us that the co-teacher was let go because of no-call no-show and not because of this incident.  After receiving this information in writing, I turned it over to Washoe County and filed a complaint with them.  The social worker that handles their inspections followed up on the complaint and you can now find it on childcareinspections.washoecounty.us under Sonshine Preschool.  They could not prove or disprove the incident since my child was not harmed but the complaint is now filed there and anyone can go and read it.  

Please, please do not send your child here if they fall outside of the bell curve.  Our son definitely falls outside of the bell curve.  He is incredibly smart and we firmly believe they were boring him and that is probably why he was acting out.  He speaks very well and has a very large vocabulary.  He can count all the way up to 20 and knows his ABCs as well as his phonetic alphabet.  We actually are in the beginning stages of teaching him how to read.  We have him lined up with another preschool but we are waiting to send him until he gets the evaluation by the county.  We really don't want him to suffer another disappointment like this and will be doing our due diligence as parents.",2014-10-01 17:41:45

It took me pulling out my chase app to show him the card had been swiped to start the bar tab before he acquiesced and they looked at the video.

Video showed he in fact gave it to another person in the bar! What did they offer me in return? Just a half apology. Not a bottle of wine. Not an invitation for supper. Nothing. Just a ""mistakes happen"" sorry. Well, mistakes do happen...but this is the hospitality industry folks. Be hospitable. Do you have any idea how frustrating and inconvenient it is leaving someone without a debit card and access to cash during Mardi Gras?!?!? What's that worth to you? 

The amazing thing is, the night they lost it we only stopped by for a quick drink with friends and had already made dinner plans at Justine the following night. We chose to keep those even despite this disaster because I figured there would be a 0% chance they'd allow me to pay for dinner. Wrong again. I made sure to alert the manager when we arrived so she knew we were there...wasn't like they forgot about this. The waitress, while very kind, offered only a round a drinks! So, Justine loses my debit card, gives it to someone else leaving me open for fraud, renders me cashless during Mardi Gras, makes me have to spend time changing all my auto pay features on multiple platforms and that's worth what? A couple drinks? Laughable

I arrived at about 10 p.m. , there were no ribs ready and there was no macaroni and cheese ready. I was informed that both will take at least 20 minutes. I patiently waited to 20 minutes, thinking that my time invested would surely pay off. When I got home, the ribs were far from tender and the macaroni and cheese look like a gooey mess. The macaroni and cheese was severely underdone. The Sweet potatoes had way too much lemon extract. Overall I was extremely disappointed and felt as though my money was wasted. I will definitely make sure to always go to the location closer to Broad Street. It does not seem as though the two locations use the same recipes. My friend's chicken was also dry. However he did say the cabbage was good.",2017-08-21 20:44:32

Lots of foodies in the area and many good restaurants at a stone's throw means lots of competition.

The menu is basic pub grub, with no real standouts. My wife and I were surprised to see how crowded it was for such a common menu. I think the draw is just because it's new, but over time things may dwindle down if they don't offer something unique.

This space used to be to Solaris, which was a tired old restaurant whose time had come. Unfortunately, this new replacement isn't much better. The interior is shiny and new, but cold and noisy. You can't hear yourself think here, let alone have a conversation. The annex is an old house that is attached to the main building, and doesn't match the decor or quality of materials in the main part. The spaces feel like two separate restaurants.

The wait staff is confused and slow, lots of running around and forgetful service. They're friendly but not very professional.

Beer and wine list is adequate but focus on mostly California wines and the usual Philadelphia beers you see in every local bar. They had an oak-aged Scotch Ale which was the most unique offering.

All-in-all, not a bad place if you want a salty burger and a beer. But nothing new, and the whole place seems to be unsure of its identity. Feels like they started out with a much grander concept of what they wanted, and then ran into budget and/or management issues and had to settle for less.",2011-08-29 21:17:47

I appreciate that they offer it and that it's good! I tried the Chicken Pesto sandwich and it's by far the best one I've had. I next tried the chicken salad. And If I were reviewing this place on that sandwich alone i would be giving one star. There wasn't a lot of meat and not a lot of flavor. And for the shower I ordered 8 different sandwiches and almost 75% of them were left at the end of the shower. It was slightly embarrassing (for me and for Sloco!). Many of the guests were excited to try Sloco when they heard that's where the sandwiches were from. But word spread quickly that they weren't flavorful and I was left with a lot of sandwiches. 

I'm not ruling Sloco out in the future, but it's definitely not top of mind when I'm looking for a good, quick lunch. I live in 12South and Sloco is a short walk away... I just wish they had more to offer. I wish them the best, I really do, it's just not my first choice.",2011-12-30 02:57:14

Food: The food was very underwhelming, maybe because I've had some very authentic Thai food in the US and in Thailand. I was disappointed at the texture and freshness of the ingredients. The meat felt overcooked, losing its juicy and tenderness. The veggies were undercooked, which works for some veggies, because it provides freshness.

I WALKED into their ER on Christmas Eve 2011 on the advice of a doc I had seen the day before, who told me that I was in a state of AFIB, (which I had never heard of till then). I spent 6 hours waiting for them to help me, I have since been told I should have said ""I have a heart issue"", and I supposedly would have gotten help sooner. Several times I could have and almost did walk out, but finally I was taken to a small room, where an assistant took my vitals and then left for 30 minutes returning with something in a cup I was told I needed to drink, (found out later it was a GI Cocktail) so I did. Next thing I know they want to admit me to the hospital and then everything after that was a blank page.

Long story short, I woke from a 5 day coma where I had 3 strokes, died 2 or 3 times and that I had been ""spine stroked"" that had left me paralyzed from the waist down, with my father standing over me, who had flown from Alaska, being told that his son would most likely not be alive when he got here!!!!!

After my discharge from Brandon Hospital, I spent 16 months in an assisted living hell hole and was finally able to move back to my home here in Tampa. Where I still remain in a wheelchair, daily PT is my life, the employer I moved from Alaska to here for, apparently is no longer interested and there is no way to get any kind of help or monetary compensation from the hospital!

I will start with the positive, once we received our food it was phenomenal. I dined with my mother, 10 year old neice, and 3 yr old nephew. We were all impressed with our selection. 

We went around 1:30pm last Saturday. It was a first trip for each. Ordering in a new restaurant with two children is a task in its self. However, the adult working behind the counter was not helpful at all. She seemed annoyed we were unfamiliar with the process. She also did not speak very loudly, so when she did ask a question or make a statement she became further annoyed. I was so uncomfortable I finally just began answering with which ever option I could hear clearly. Not a great first impression on customer service. We ended up with cheesy bread sticks, a Hawaiian style pizza, and chicken cesar Salad. Again, when the food finally arrived the fresh ingredients were outstanding.

When I went to fill up the drinks at the foundation, the nozzle popped of the sweet tea canister, soaking me.  To prevent the tea from spewing halfway across the resturant I took my medium size drink glass and tried to block the liquid so it went into the drain instead of out into the resturant or on other diners. I asked my 10 year old to alert the staff.  She had to tell them 3 times their drink machine was spewing everything into the floor before one of the teenagers grabbed a bucket to come assist. In her defense she did not have direct eyeline view of the drink machines, but her lack of attentiveness to what a customer was trying to tell her was indicative of our entire experience with each of the staff. When she came around the counter she sprang into action to catch the remaining half of the canister. To her credit she did say she was sorry. But no staff member asked if I needed anything to help clean myself up since I was soaked. I had to wait in line to get into a bathroom. They only had electronic hand dryers, so I was unable to have a wet paper towel to clean the now sticky tea off my legs, torso, arms, etc. Or to dry off. 

I'm a pretty laid back person, so my families way of coping with the disastrous customer service was to laugh at the fact I was soaked. Who wants to ruin their day with things you can't control.

I booked a lunch reservation a week in advance for 30 work colleagues from US Central Command for a Hail and Farewell.  I chatted with the women who took our reservation to make certain that they were good with a group that size, and separate checks.  She said that they were, and even indicated where she would seat us.  I'd been to the location when it was a different establishment, and agreed that her plan would work.

When my group showed up that Monday at 11:30, there were groups sitting in the area that I had discussed when booking.  The waitress/hostess told me that someone in uniform had come in 30 minutes earlier (right when they opened) and cancelled the reservation for 30.  When I explained that I had booked the reservation, and I certainly hadn't cancelled it, she shrugged her shoulders.

Here's where it gets interesting.  When I asked her who the individual in uniform spoke with, she said that he spoke with her.  Because she was the only one there.  So, if you open at 11:00, have a reservation for 30, plus your normal lunch crowd, you only have one person there thirty minutes before they arrive?

I suspect that they forgot about the reservation, didn't schedule sufficient staff to accommodate us, and chose the ""a guy in uniform walked in 30 minutes ago"" as an excuse for turning us away.

Searched for the bread to order an extra loaf and did not see it anywhere.. also did not see any section to add a ""note"".

Honestly this really upset me as I live 20 mins away and planned on being there at 4 (the start of the window I selected upon ordering). Immediately we hopped in the car to go get it.

Arrive at Johnny Carino's and parked in the pick up spots.

He does. 10 mins later he approaches them and asks who exactly he's supposed to be waiting for -after saying ""excuse me"" to them 4 times (still arguing about roles and responsibilities for the evening) to get their attention. They say ""oh, her"" and point to the woman. He asks- did anyone happen to tell her I was waiting??? --no....  The whole time he sees our bag (it's the only one on the ledge, and we paid online so they could've checked and given him the bag instead of making him wait.)

We get home and I look at the receipt stapled to the bag. It says ""2:52"" which means after I ordered at 2:25 it was made...forget that I selected a 4-4:30 window...which also means when the woman said it had been made quite some time ago that it had been sitting for well over an hour!!!! As you can imagine it was cold.... and the loaf of bread originally put in the bag was as hard a brick!

The beef in the soup was well seasoned and the highlight of this dish which was scarce on veggies and other goodies that sometimes garnish noodle soup.  The bok choy was not overcooked though, which is good.  The soup base had no depth or soul and was not worth even drinking a little bit when the noodles were gone.  The stirfried noodles were again nothing special.  The lamb shishkabob which is a popular street food all over China was ok but under-seasoned: I could barely taste the cumin and chile.

I got my order and she opened the boxes to show me...I was so surprised to see dry wings...there is no Thai curry sauce on them...it's the same case with Parmesan tooo. I wondered and asked the girl why they are dry, to my surprise she simply answered that how the wings will be. I went into my car and ate one Thai curry wing. I FELT IT IS PATHETIC AND WORST.

We started with the house salad. It was a ginger based simple salad. The lettuce was fresh. The dressing was a bit too tart for a Japanese type salad. My plate hate a decent helping of dressing, my gf's was drowning in it.  Next, the vegetable tempura. This was actually the only thing that was really good. Tasty, hot, fresh. Tempura sauce was served in the tiniest of dishes so we ran out before we finished the veggies.  

Then came the sushi. Initial impression was not good. Looked sloppily put together. The salmon was not good. The fish was not entirely fresh. You can tell by the texture. Salmon sake should have a smooth taste when entering the palette, but instead it was kind of a wrinkled impression and it did not have that delicate buttery characteristic that you expect from a fresh piece of fish. The yellowtail was the same. Nothing spectacular, just forgettable. The worst on the plate was the spider roll. It was small, sloppy, and had a simply gross and indescribable harsh flavor to it.  

Here's the worst part. We ate less than half of the sushi we ordered. We told our waitress about the problem, and while she was quite apologetic, we never had the chef/owner/manager come to the table to inquire about the problem. We received a bill for the full amount of sushi. It's best, at the very least, to offer to comp the bill. No one did that. That's not good practice.

The charge showed up for BOTH beers when i checked in the morning, and the same happened for my friend when we already paid CASH for the two beers! Mistake #3. We left right after finishing our drinks because the workers completely ruined our vibe by that point.

We inquired with the host about the hold up and he assured us it would be just another minute or two. At that point, we had already waited 30 minutes, what was an extra couple? At the 45 minute mark, we had asked for our bottles of wine back, and the host had the gall to ""politely"" refuse and said they were setting up the table.

The food was good (nothing spectacular but good nonetheless). The chef even came out and asked if we enjoyed our meal.

I discovered that there is a procedure called a coronectomy. A coronectomy is often recommended when the tooth's roots are close to important nerves, to avoid nerve damage especially with patients over 40 years old. 

I visited another oral surgery office with my x-ray and they discussed both options, the removal and the coronectomy and the Oral surgeon suggested that the coronectomy  was the best option for me.

I was initially excited to have a location out this way but after 2 visits stick a fork in me. My first stop was to introduce my fam so I got them some pesto bowls. As another reviewer stated the floor at the counter was a mess and considering how new it is this should not be the case. Maybe they were so busy and didn't have a chance to clean which i'd give them but since someone saw the same thing on another day its not flying. Got 2 small bowls and 1 regular or is it regular and large but at any rate they were a joke. I should say I frequent the o'fallon location and they use one container for their bowls and just adjust the amount. So when I got the small bowl, that would probably feed a small child to satisfaction, I was left hungry. And for the amount you pay that just doesn't work for me. Anyway got the food to go and when I got home realized they forgot the pesto sauce on top. So when I called and spoke with the manager after initially being hung up on she knew my order w/o even me telling her as if they already knew they goofed. She offered to remake the bowls w/o me bringing the old back. 

The food was cooked good minus the one tough over cooked piece of chicken and in my photo the large burnt spec and a few small from the pan that made it in my food. Had they added the pesto it might have been fine but I would have still been upset about the size.

Returned to have them remake the bowls and the cook overcompensated on the pesto and the bowl was swimming in it this time. But insult to injury is that the pesto flavor was aweful and very lemony. Food was cooked well but I wish it didn't have the pesto to ruin it. 

I should have reviewed this place a month or so ago but since I pass by regularly I've already noticed a decline in patrons. So many businesses have failed at this location and I believe Crazy bowls will be added to the list. I'd give it a few more months before they shut their doors for good.",2018-05-29 19:41:11

Our first visit was less than impressive. It was not busy and there seemed to be enough staff, but the waitresses were completely uninterested in working. 

One couple arrived at the same time as us, but walked out after being ignored for 20 minutes. Interestingly, a waitress was very prompt about removing the menus from the vacated table. 

Our waitress visited our table a total of four times: to take our order, to bring our food, to leave the bill, and to pick up payment. We were never visited to ask if we needed anything. No refills on our coffee or water... nothing. 

The food was OK, but certainly not worth the poor service.

My husband returned without me several weeks later and nothing had improved. Three female servers hanging out at the counter, chatting it up, while one guy hustled from table to table. It's almost as though these women are trying to sabotage the place, forcing people to not want to return.

The first problem I had was while I was pregnant, I ordered beef on a stick(as I have multiple times before because it was my pregnancy go to) I walked over to get it and walked back home. When I got home I saw that not even half of the stick had beef of it. Each one has maybe 1/3 meat on it(as I said I ordered before and it had more then half of the stick covered with meat every time) so I called to tell them. There exact words were ""this is the way we make it, you don't order beef on stick no more"" ignorant owners, lazy cookers. 

I ordered from here another time when I was very sick with a newborn, so I couldn't walk over to pickup food so I had it delivered. It's literally a minute drive. Right down the street so you would think the delivery person would be appreciative it was a easy drive. Nope ! It took an hour to get to me, I had 15$ in cash and the meal was 14$ but I wasn't going to tip a 1$ I found that rude. So I politely asked the guy did he have change for a 100$. He said ""ugh no I don't I can take it into the store though and bring you change"" Like sir you are not gunna take my money and I'm not gunna just trust you to bring back. So I said no that's fine I'll call the restaurant and give them my card number, so he rolled his us said ""what the fuck bro"" and started walking back to his car. I called the restaurant and said he was ignorant but they didn't care they just said ok card number, so I gave it to them. I hang up and go back outside. He's in his car. Sees me and drives away. Not giving me my phone. I watch him pull into the shopping center (that's how close my house is) and stop in front of the restaurant. I call and tell them he didn't give me my food.

In those days Nunzio would come to our table and there was usually a nice treat sent out with his 'compliments'. Times have certainly changed and with success sometimes a place forgets the early days...
I went out last night with the same group of friends. One of them is vegetarian so she ordered a pasta dish on the menu that is served with sausage but asked to have it without sausage. So basically pasta and broccoli rabe. She was also splitting it because her and another friend ordered salads too. The server mentioned a sharing fee of 5.00 which while antiquated I guess still exists in some restaurants. However, one would think that an 18.00 dollar dish without the main ingredient would be offered at a lower price. Not only was she charged full price but also the 5.00 fee so now two tiny bowls of noodle and broccoli are costing 23.00. That's more than my Lobster Ravioli! This is in no way the server's fault, and we are generous tippers. However it certainly effected our mood and we asked to speak with a manager or the chef.  After 15-20 minutes the manager came to our table and did not seem to care at all. He said of course when we asked about the pricing and claimed they got a bigger portion due to no meat - they did not. He was arrogant and reluctantly  removed five dollars off our tab. We will not return to Nunzio's.

biscuit is STELLAR! im a true biscuit snob and it may make my top 3. i need more samples. 

the menu and ingredients are stellar. i had the fried green tomato sandwich and it was made SO well. it was gorgeous, piping hot, and delicious

however the main reason i give it a 2 is because of the pricing. its outrageous. im the type that would go to alinea tomorrow and drop $150.00-$200.00 without thinking twice. 

my fried green tomato biscuit, side of grits, and unlimited coffee was nearly $19. $15 i would be ok with but $19 is insane. 

oh also if you are looking for your sausage egg biscuit or bacon/egg/cheese - go elsewhere. i bet they would sell tons but they use fancy schmancy ingredients but they execute VERY well. I like they have a strict focus on what they are food wise

lets take coffee for example. unlimited refills adds another dollar so that brings it to $3.50. starbucks drip is like $2 bucks. you stay there you can get free refills if a gold star member i believe. even if im wrong, im really wondering how they justify a $2.50-$3.50 price point on coffee which obviously is reflected in pricing of the whole menu when its NOT full service which is actually ok by me. 

i think its the contradiction you see visually where you walk in and see the ordering counters and the fact that most of its is self serve and self clean yet the prices on the items are insane. i really wonder how they justify the margins. im sure part of the existence of the concept is to stay relevant with millenials but the pricing structure obviously isn't. 

so my stomach says yes but my wallet says no and remember i will drop $100-$200 at kayne without thinking twice. 

definitely worth at least one visit.

I really, really, really wanted to like this place. Like others I was a bit put off by reviews about a long wait time for delivery. I decided I would give the food a try but go and pick up the food myself. When I called to place the order from my home, I was greeted on the phone by someone who answered the phone like it was their private home line. I decided to let that go. In the middle of me placing my order, the first woman gave the phone to someone else, all without any explanation. At which point I had to start my order again from the beginning. The second phone person was not very professional either in her phone manners but again I let that go. She briskly told me ""I'll have that ready for you in 20 minutes"" and hung up the phone. Again, I let this go. She did sound a little young so I gave them this third pass in poor customer service. At no time while I was on the phone did anyone ask my name or my number. I left my house with more than enough time to make the 20 minute they suggested it would take to get my food ready. Now mind you there was significant rain coming down tonight, something that I do not blame the restaurant for at all, but I left my house, in the rain, with the expectation that I would take responsibility for the prompt delivery of my own food. When I got to the restaurant, the CLOSED sign was on. I thought surely this is a mistake so I turned the knob to enter the restaurant, but it was locked. The lights were still lit in the restaurant and within a few minutes a woman came to the door. She opened the door and asked could I help you. I told her I had called in an order for pick up. She looked at me like I was crazy and like she did not know what I was talking about. I asked, Is this Kingston City, and checked again the sign over the door to make sure that I was at the right place. She responded that it was Kingston City. Then she asked me how long ago did I order. I told her like 20-25 minutes. She tells me, oh everyone is gone, they usually close at 9pm but they had an emergency and had to leave early. I was so speechless I just walked away. 

Now lest anyone get the wrong idea I just want to be clear. I can accept that businesses and business owners have emergencies. I own a small business myself and this having to close early can happen to anyone. What I do not accept however is the total lack of customer service and appropriate management of a business in the case of an emergency. When they left this woman in charge of the business, because of the emergency, why was she not instructed about incoming orders?  Additionally, if at the point when I placed my order, they had taken my name and number, this same woman could have called me and let me know that the restaurant would not be able to fulfill my order. This is ridiculous lack of professionalism that seems symptomatic of this restaurants larger issues which things like having missing items on the menu and extremely long wait times, as outlined by other reviews reflect. 

I hope that their food is good. However not everyone who can cook is cut out to own a business. If you can't combine good food with good customer service your time in the restaurant business will be extremely short lived.",2014-07-24 01:02:41

The sales associate, Jasmine, was fantastic through the whole process. He took the car home for 48 hours and I rode back with him as we intended to purchase the car. When we sat down to iron out the deal, again Jasmine was kind and professional. We let her know we did not want the ""Napleton Experience"" as it wasn't convenient for oil changes and we already have towing etc through our insurance. She was required I assume to talk to her sales manager Mike. He was clearly irritated from the moment he sat down. Mike kept throwing out payment ranges that were ""all he can do""! He was abrupt and evasive. We had done financing app online to expedite the  appointment. When I attempted to ask what interest rate he was basing those payments on (as they were WAY off of what we knew they should be).....he promptly  said ""well that's none of my business, they don't tell me those thing!!!"" He was agitated. I simply  said, ""well it's our business, can you please find out. We applied online and have excellent credit. These payments you're quoting are too high."" Keep in mind, we weren't even trying to negotiate a lower car  price.  He clearly did not like me trying to pin down his fast talking nonsense.   When he returned he started rattling through some things, none of which gave us an interest rate OR addressed the removal of the Napleton Experience (for approx $900).   I had my laptop open as I had come from work. I also received a text from a client's father while he was talking. As I'm responding to the text Mike says ""I'll wait."" in a snarky tone. My husband says ""no,, no, go ahead"" as he knew what I was doIng. Mike B (sales MANAGER)) proceeded to say ""No, I'll wait since she can't seem to keep her face out of her phone!!!"". So mike wasn't happy that a woman (who questioned his tactics) wasn't hanging on his every word. My husband then said ""woah, there is no reason to be disrespectful"" to which Mike the sales manager replied ""Well she hasn't shown me any respect here!!! She hasn't made eye contact with me this whole time!! On her computer and phone......"". I was STUNNED silent as I have NEVER been spoken to like that in my life!! We have been buying used cars for 25 years and have always had a respectful exchange. My husband stood up and said ""I think we are going to leave"". To which Mike responded ""Ya..."" And grabbed his paper and walked away. I reached out to the GM the next day (Bobby Clifford) who basically said he was sorry I had a bad experience and this was the FIRST complaint about Mike (which I find impossible to believe given how comfortable he was speaking to us that way) and that he would ""look into it"". I i told him we were ready to buy and didn't want Jasmine to suffer but that my husband was so angry he was ready looking at other dealers for cars. Bobby's super effective, high quality, ""how can we fix this"" solution was to tell me ""well you probably shouldn't spend your money at a dealer you feel treated you that way.""  THAT WAS IT!!!! No further contact, no discussion, no trying to fix things.....ZERO!!! I can't say I'm surprised. I'm sure Mike had already come in to spin his disgusting behavior in advance knowing we likely would call. So clearly Napleton Hyundai management could not care LESS about customer service or selling cars! All of the other employees we came into contact with were very nice and professional. It's unfortunate they are losing sales due to their sales manager Mike B and Bobby the GM. It was THE WORST car buying interaction we have had in 25 years.",2020-01-16 22:15:33

   . I am from Ridely Township. I grew up going to Double Decker and I love it.  I just recently moved back home to my fathers house who lives in Chadds Ford Pennsylvania.  What I remember about Double Decker  is how wonderful the service was and how delicious the food tastes.  Well I have to tell you you guys have really taken a turn for the worse. 

  Sadly the only pizza store around where my dad lives is this store  end it does not live up to the reputation that you have worked 30 years to uphold.  I called 3 to 4 times per week to get the same thing two baked pepperoni inside outs with light sauce and light cheese. Each night now 3 in a row,  which really disgusts me because I literally would go to a garbage can if it wasn't for my kids to get food over this place. I call and they do this without fail each time. Once is a mistake, twice is annoying 3 times is theft. They are literally barely able to speak a word of English and try to steal from customers. 

   Each of the past 3 days my order WHICH IS THE EXACT SAME except school pizza which we will now get from Concord pizza and pay more because it kills me how much you have changed. I get the bales inside outs with Light sauce and light cheese and 3 days in a row the non English speakers charge me 17.00 for the 2 inside outs when it's 11.00. Now after I confronted him yesterday and said 2 times seems intentional, I cal today and I get the same thing. What happens, he charges me 17 again. Then says oh sorry I added extra Cheese and extra sauce knowing he has taken my order 3 previous days. I again say 3 times is no accident and he says it was. To which I say perhaps then I speak to someone who can speak English. Well he puts on another NON ENGLISH speaker who yells at me and refuses to answer why he has over charged me 3 days in a row for the same order until I confront him. He then says we don't want or need your business and says go away to another place where ppl speak English. 

How can you run a biz where there is constant mistakes, they speak to customers like that, they literally try and steal from you and you can not ask why. This is not the Double Decker I know. These men are mean and thieves. They pretend to not understand you but they do When it comes to money. Horrid place horrid management and I will tell everyone including Garnet Valley HS TO NOT ORDER AGAIN! Period. How can you talk to a customer like that. 

I need a response and a reason. Let the drivers and phone girls answer and the people who have a hard time understanding customers off the phones it's common sense. Not to mention the way they treat you when you are there! 

STAY AWAY FROM DOUBLE DECKER UNLESS ITS RIDLEY! A well run great place to get a meal!!

Upon questioning why the long wait (the entire winter), I was told it takes 6-8 weeks to acquire the required materials. Check my math, but that would be Feb 21, 2019 at the latest. I haven't called in the drafty doors that may as well be open yet because honestly all their warrantee department does is say they can't do anything at all, or can ""come and check it out"" months and months later.

I can't believe we spent so much money for this and will continue to have the same issue.

First, the water temperature of our shower was at best barely luke warm at it's hottest setting. We couldn't take the shower we wanted at the end of a long day of driving because it was just way too cold. Next, the heater in our room wasn't working correctly. When I called down, I was told that they were finicky and to give it a while. We ended up waking up at 2am sweating to the room nearly at 80 degrees when we had it set to 72 degrees. I then had to turn on the AC just to get it back down to a comfortable level and just wait it out for fear the room would endlessly blast cold air into the 60s. To top it off our room faced whatever public transit and there was just loud noise/banging in the early morning.

We came in around 3pm on Fat Tuesday. Every other bar on Frenchman was jam-packed but this place was completely empty, save for the band setting up. We picked a table one row back from the band and stayed for around 3 hours, all the while ordering round after round of drinks, enjoying the live music, and tipping the band. After several hours the place began to fill up. People started crowding around and we actually shared our table with a couple from Michigan. Out of nowhere the bartender came by and slapped a ""reserved"" placard on our table without uttering a single word. We're thinking: cool, we've been here so long he's reserving our table for us. Wrong! About 30 minutes later he came back again and literally picked up our table and carried it outside. When we're like ""what the heck? that's our table!"" he had the nerve to tell us we could still sit at our table...OUTSIDE. Mind you it's about 39 degrees out there. 

When I went to complain to the owner or manager, who had been hanging around the front door most of the time we'd been there, he had the audacity to pass the buck on his employee's rude and uncalled for behavior, basically just saying ""hey it wasn't me."" Might not have been you but it was YOUR employee, most assuredly working under your direction. Then the employee walks up to us and when I explained how rude it was to not give us a heads up that he would be taking our table away in about 30 minutes he looked over at the owner/manager and asked him something completely unrelated to what I was telling him. He completely ignored me. 

At a minimum I expected at least an acknowledgement that yes he could have warned us of our imminent ejectment. It seems their incredibly rude and unprofessional behavior toward customers is reflected in how long they've been in business: just a few weeks. If this is how they treat paying customers I don't expect them to establish a foothold in an area where there are bars and live music aplenty.

My story starts out with me renting a new house in Philly.  I can only use comcast, so as i go to signup it tells me that there is already an open account at the address. So after speaking with some Indian who sole desire is to sell me a package i dont want, I tell him that the house says there is an open account.  He says ok and I shit you not 15mins of complete silence later i say ""hello"" and he asks if that's the package i want to buy.  At that point I had half a mind to ask him where in New Delhi he resides because ill be on the next plane. So before i loose my shit, i tell him to transfer me to customer service immediately.

 So I'm transferred to an automated service which prompts me to enter the phone number where i want service.  Im from Indiana and still have an Indianapolis area code but i live in Philly, see where the problem is?  the automation doesn't give me an out so i use my phone and surprise surprise I'm hooked up with an Indiana rep.  He was cool and transferred me to the right area.  So now i tell them that the house has been vacant for some months now and I'm trying to set up service.  The lady comes back and says"" because the people before you  went delinquent  their security team bars any service to that address"".  How do you bar a whole place from service?  I can understand putting the names on a blacklist, but a rental house that changes name often?  You would think after it goes delinquent that they just send it to collections. I ask them what their account has to do with me and i dont know who those people are.  I get the whole company policy speech.  I was told I would have to go to Comcast with a lease, utility bill, vile of blood etc lol. So I tell them that you are doing a credit check on me so that should be sufficient.  So after getting the same three worlds, I ask to speak with her supervisor.  I get put on hold for 5mins so he can be adequately ""prepped"" on what to say.  So he repeats verbadium what she said, and you could tell he is reading a script because I had asked him a question and he rudely interjected ""let me finish"" and says well this place is very close.  I pull up and its on the other side of town and tells me the hours.  I tell him well i work 6 days a week and by the time i get home they would be close.  So i get a fake apology and theres nothing he could do.  He says only the security team can take off the block.  So i ask if i could just send my info to their security team.  He says no and it has to go through the comcast office.  I told him thats pointless and inefficient .  And i pretty much get a ""tough shit"" attitude.  So i ask cant he have one of the company's employees take time out of their day to drive to an empty house and confirm?  He says no they dont do that.  And then i have a smart idea that would make tons of sense.  I ask him to talk to my realtor and they would confirm that house is vacant and I have nothing to do with the previous tenants.  He says no and that it has to be the person using the service.  Really?  Common sense would dictate that the property owner  would be the 2nd best verification and all questions would be answered.

We've been going to Sapporo 2 since it opened, have taken many friends, have recommended to others, etc.  It's been a celebratory place for us every few months at least.  Our last visit, around Thanksgiving wasn't great.  The quality had obviously degraded.  But, we went again last night, just to check that the prior visit was a fluke.  It was early and not busy at all.  Only 3 tables.  The nice young man who was our server was obviously new.  As someone who worked in the industry in college, I'm very forgiving about that.  But, the woman ""giving him guidance"", barely did that, was pretty aggressive with him and it was all pretty uncomfortable to watch.  The sushi chef, the other woman and another man stood behind the sushi bar talking and it took 15 minutes for anyone to notice we'd finished, not gotten water we'd asked for, had empty beers, and had a menu open and were prepared to order more, to maybe give another shot.  We did order a few more pieces just to see, and I will say the egg roe pieces were pretty good.

Now, I'll get to the food.   Wow.  To say that it's declined would be an understatement.  (They had new menus featuring a lot more than sushi, but since that's what we go there for, we weren't interested - if they no longer want to focus on sushi, they should rebrand and take if off the menu).  It was some of the worst sushi I've had in a restaurant.  I've eaten sushi all over the world and always liked Sapporo2, but I've had better from Schnucks take-away.  We ordered mostly Nigiri and Sashimi and one roll.  The rice seemed old.  Barely held together.  The pieces of Nigiri were VERY skimpy and VERY thin in size, dry on the edges, and had almost no flavor.  My favorite, Mackerel, might has well have been thin tofu.  The Sashimi ""selection"" we ordered was only salmon and maybe tuna?, and very skimpy.  

All in all, it breaks my heart a little.  I hate it when a place goes down.  Perhaps they're business was sold, isn't doing well and they're cutting corners.  Not a great thing to do for sushi....  I would have happily paid more for a better quality.  And, if they want to move away from sushi altogether, maybe they can rebrand and save their business.  

I MIGHT give them one more try, maybe order something away from the sushi menu, just to see.  But, sadly, I think this could be the end for some fairly frequent customers, who would always spend at least $100 on sushi and beers.  Good luck to them, and I really hope for their sake they can turn things around.",2019-03-16 15:53:24

Our breakfast arrived. My vegetable omelet consisted of a lump of eggs and cheese with a side order of veggies cooked to death. The server was so pretentious that we avoided asking her anything. She asked if I enjoyed my omelet because most of it was still on my plate when she cleared the table. She was shocked when I said it wasn't really an omelet.

It was a surprise to have chanced upon this location (because I thought all were closed down.)
Mistakes were made.

When I first walked in, no acknowledgment that my father and I had entered. This just seems to be the downfall of most froyo/ice cream places: hiring young workers who would rather talk to each other than to the customers. Whatever, I just want my froyo anyways.

That's where things get underwhelming. Sweet CeCe's used to impress with a massive variety of flavors, this place only had 6 flavors. 9 if you count the mixing of two flavors a new one. 

I got the cupcake batter with some cookie dough on top. Cookie dough was delish along with the frozen yogurt. It's just a pity that they don't Cookies N' Cream anymore. 

Overall, with the froyo fad dying down, this is a decent place to go to because of their flat-price cups. If you're like me and enjoy minimal human interaction in the food industry, then come here. Others might find that a bit of a downside though.",2018-10-05 04:12:31

I grew up less than a miles from Forest Park, and had always wanted to visit this restaurant, since it's setting was historical.  Along with mt 7 year old daughter and 16 of my family members, we asked how long our wait would be.  We knew it would be some time for a large group to get a seat and were more than happy to wait.  We were told it would be between 1-1 1/2 hours to wait.  
Since we were at THE BOATHOUSE, we thought, a boat ride would take up the time.  Leaving someone within 20 feet of the Hostess stand to make sure if our names were called we could place orders via cell phone so to not waste anyone's time.  (We thought we had thought of everything.  We were wrong).

we paddled gleefully around the pond for less than 40 minutes (it is a timed excursion, you pay by the hour and any time over),  we checked with the Hostess who promptly informed us that ""I called you over and over, you weren't here, I gave your table away"".  We were told 60-90 minutes, and had informed them that we were going to take a paddle boat, but would be leaving someone to inform us if a table became available.  So, we asked how long would it be to get another table, and were informed bruskly: ""well, you're at the bottom of the list now"". The person we had left at the desk had not moved from their post, and did NOT hear any call of our name or party number.   I can only assume that the hostess didn't see our large numbered party and assumed we had left.  
We asked the manager. The manager informed us ""well, it's your fault, you went out on a boat"".  (yes, it was, but the rudeness was uncalled for, and we were assured that our wait would be well over an hour).
Large parties are hard to seat, but for them to be as rude as they were was uncalled for. We left after 2 1/2 hours with hungry kids and upset adults. Inconsiderate staff and rude manager.  Sadly, people will always go, because of the boats.

First, the beef quesadillas were HUMONGOUS, WAY TOO BIG, and not easily picked up & eaten by hand as we're used to. They were also EXTREMELY GREASY & just NOT GOOD AT ALL; FLAVORLESS.

Next, my crab enchiladas were almost ALL VEGGIES (corn, etc) with VERY LITTLE Crab meat; EXTREMELY Disappointing, considering I USUALLY always get a chicken or a beef enchilada, (not big on seafood w/ a Mexican dish, cause I usually like my crustaceans sans cheese). On this particular occasion I was kinda sick of chicken and crab was the ONLY other alternative & the VERY NICE waiter suggested it so I went with it. I was not happy.

Even the Margaritas, which are USUALLY my SAVING GRACE were UNREMARKABLE, BLAND, TEPID, MEDIOCRE. I had a frozen strawberry which was NOT WORTH the Xtra dolores, & was in NO WAY, FRESH & a regular/house lime on the rocks which was HORRIBLE, tasted like a VERY BLAND MIX with NOOOO ALCOHOL in it (NOT saying there was NONE, but I DIDN'T taste it).

They let the dealerships treat the customers the way they do...For example they don't even sell the air suspension Touareg in US, or a couple of other top of the line models that I won't list right now, but to me it just shows how they treat the US market - 'US customers are dumb and that is what they deserve'...I'm sorry but this is my conclusion, when I compare to the VW dealerships in EU.

Most of the time only two registers are open and the staff here will wait until the line is far into produce to finally (begrudgingly) open a third.

Unbelievably BAD ATTITUDE of the lady at the front desk. 

What a shame.  This could be a great member of the established and growing 12 South business district, but the horrible rudeness of the woman at the counter instead makes it the worst business in the area.  I thought she was having a bad day the first time she was rude, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She was worse the second trip, so I told her I was never coming back, that I would tell others to avoid this store, and that my decision was made based 100% on her rude behavior.  She said she didn't care, doesn't need my business. 

I told my wife not to go there, but my wife said I probably blew it out of proportion. The next week, my wife--who is the sweetest person you could ever meet--came home and told me she was done with Royal Cleaners due to the same rude treatment. 

The convenience of the location must be the only thing that keeps the doors open here, as there is nothing special about the the quality of their clothes laundering/dry cleaning.

I stayed at the Fairfield Inn last night and I was the least bit impressed.  Luckily, I'm being reimbursed by my company for my stay because otherwise, I'd be livid.  The room literally stunk.  I thought it might have just been my room, so I requested another one.  Nope, that one smelled too.  So I called my boss who was also staying there to ask her if her room smelled.  Apparently, it did.  She said she couldn't take it so she opened 2 packs of coffee spread it around the room and used the door as a fan to try to circulate the ""aroma.""  Well, I don't like coffee, nor do I want to smell like it, so I was SOL.

Marriott honestly needs to either do some renovations and change out all the carpets, fix the apparent mold problem, invest in Febreze, or better yet, do ALL!

Also, for it to be DE, I thought the price of the room was kinda high.  Maybe I'm underestimating our ""first state,"" but for $140 on a Monday night, I expect a normal smelling room, a flat panel TV and HBO or some other movie channel.  Instead, I got a musty smelling room as my boss put it, a tube TV and no movies.

They did not inform me of any issue until I explicitly asked what would be my wait time. They told me they couldn't say. I asked if it would be more than 1.5 hours and they said that ""most likely more than that"". Needless to say I left. I needed a car to get to the plantations by noon! I was lucky to find a highly rated rental service through Yelp. They came to pick us up at the hotel 15 minutes later.

Markatos Services was TERRIBLE. We called them to schedule and appointment for a quote- the day of the quote, Nichole (sales manager), called me at the time of our appointment saying that she lost track of time and was going to be late. I had an appointment to get to so I just rescheduled it for another day.

When we met for the quote (on Monday), she told us that she was going to send us an email estimate for how much it would cost. She also told us that they had a ton of availability all throughout the week before our lease was up to come in and get it cleaned. Wednesday rolled around and we still had not heard from her. I called Markatos and left a voicemail that we wanted to go ahead and schedule the cleaning. When the entire day went by without me hearing back, I called Nichole's cell phone- left a voicemail. No answer OR call back. SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL. on Thursday, I AGAIN called both the office and her cell phone, never heard back. Thursday afternoon, my boyfriend finally got an email from Nichole stating that she was ""so sorry"" and gave some BS excuse as to why she never got back to me. She also said that in a matter of 3 days every single slot for next week had filled up and she couldn't get us in before our lease is up next week. 

Super angry, I emailed her asking why she would wait 4 days to email us the quote, knowing that our lease is up October 1st, and that they were going to fill up on appointments(although I don't buy it). I STILL have not heard back from her. 

Moral of the story, at least Nichole is EXTREMELY unprofessional and if I were you I wouldn't give them a penny of my money!!! However, if you do, I hope you have a much better experience than we did!",2014-09-28 04:17:24

My initial examination included numerous x-rays and a thorough analysis. At the conclusion of the exam, I was given a formal ""Proposed Treatment Plan"" which included a Periodontal Scaling (deep cleaning) of all 4 quadrants. The cost analysis CLEARLY indicated that this service were to be paid by the insurance agency, with no cost to me. 
There were also several agreeable incidental fees identified clearly to be paid by me. No problem. 
During the deep cleaning treatment, the hygienist stated that she would only complete one-half of the process pending an insurance review to determine their actual coverage (Why after half the treatment?). Unfortunately, I was then advised that my insurance would only cover the deep cleaning of a single quadrant, and that the remaining costs were my responsibility! At this point, 2 quadrants were completed. I then insisted that the remaining treatments be dismissed, and further contended that the proposed deep cleaning treatments were pre-approved in writing and to be paid by my insurance provider according to the Treatment Plan.
The office manager insisted that the insurance coverages outlined on the Treatment Plan were merely an estimate, yet the estimate clearly proposed that the insurance provider would cover these costs (albeit estimated).  
It was never disclosed that the insurance agency was NOT consulted prior to the Proposed Treatment Plan, but only after half of the treatment was completed. The result of which is misleading. 

BE AWARE of unscrupulous business practices! Especially of concern to those of us who are retirees, and social security and/or Medicare recipients, and live on a fixed income.

This was not a normal extraction. The tooth was completely on its side and totally under the gum. So the recovery process has been way different than my other ones that were extracted normally.

* Entrée portions barely big enough for a five-year-old.
* Virtually nothing on the plate except for the meat.
* We asked for the meat to be well done. What we got was meat that was charred on the outside, raw on the inside.
* When I complained about the meat, it took them 20 minutes to reheat and bring me back the SAME piece of meat instead of a new dish. This was insulting and ridiculous.
* The chips tasted rancid. The frying oil should have been changed a long time ago.
* Service was extremely slow even though there were very few customers.
* Manager just came up with excuses about the executive chef not being there and not having good staff in the kitchen. She did not even attempt to make things right to make sure we came back to give the place another chance.

Hands down the worst experience ever. Granted I get it's just a manicure, however when it's the only thing you do for yourself and the only thing you spend money on yourself for, the last thing you want to feel is like an inconvenience. My ""nail tech"" Lonnie was completely rushed for some reason. It was 1 on a Saturday. I have gel. She put acetone on to soften the gel but rather than waiting, as everyone else does, she began to drill off my polish, which she already drilled down. She was cutting my skin and causing me to bleed. I said something to the effect of ""don't you scrape the polish off as most do"" to which she didn't reply but gave me a very annoyed look and proceeded to not scrape but use a very coarse file to essentially do what she was trying to with the drill. 
She allowed my fingers to soak for no less than 15 seconds and continued to rush though the rest of the manicure subsequently missing trimming cuticles and painting 3/4 of 2 of my nails. Hanging skin. Bleeding. Shoddy polish and I left feeling like crap. Like I had just spent what takes me more than 2 hours of work to make to pay for a horrible experience. I called. I spoke to Randy who I assume is the owner and didn't get much grace or understanding. Out of principle I returned and a very nice (and fairly new) gentleman fixed her work and tried to make the situation better. He didn't excuse away the poor work and even stated that this is something that many women treat themselves to and that she should have done a better job. 
I've repeatedly dismissed the ""credit card machine is broken"" sign and have withdrew cash, despite the atm fee, even though it is clearly not a broken machine. They don't want to pay the fees. Fine! Inconvenience your customers. If that was the least I had to contend with I would probably continue going there but I will be giving my business to someone else.

When I called Ben & Irv's, rather than listening to what I had to say regarding the situation, the gentleman with whom I spoke talked over me, explaining that my son could not possibly have been exposed to salmonella in his restaurant.  The general attitude was, ""sorry your kid got sick but it wasn't us.""  Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.  That's not the point.  The point is that a child who ate in this restaurant was hospitalized several days later...it's better to be safe than sorry--make sure the meats and produce coming into the restaurant are safe and being prepared correctly.

I came to rizzeri only because of the special they had on the IPL.. like I said, worst decision ever. And now they ""swear"" I'm not burned they gave me a serum when I went back in tears and makeup to ""cover up"" my marks which are so painful. I took a trip to urgent care and they assured me they were burns and gave me a script for burn cream. So why would doctors tell me I have burns if rizzeri swears I don't ? Stop covering for your uneducated doctor and take responsibility for what he did to my face. I'll also attach photos for everyone to see what he did to my face and what they are trying to cover up and acting like it's totally normal. It is not normal. It's not normal for the dr to treat me the way he did. I'm suppose to go back for a follow up in 2 weeks with another doctor... so for 2 weeks my only option is to walk around with burns all over my head. Thanks Dr. Dimetri your completely destroying my confidence and my skin. You literally ruined my face and I will never get over it.

So sad to say we had a very disappointing dinner here.  We went with intent to sit outside for distancing and fresh air.  However we were made to order inside, which had a line, and had to stand just a few feet from the women who took our order(outside ordering would be much better). They had changed their drink menu and the women who took our order was rude and inpatient with our questions.  My favorite drink no longer existed. So I ordered a Margarita.   My drink was awful.  My husband's manhattan was half the normal size. When the server brought out our drinks, she pointed to where I could get my own water.  She can bring me drinks but not water? When our food came, the chicken was over cooked, the cornbread was dry.  The music was so loud and crackly we decided to take our food and leave.  Interesting, they had no problem bringing our food and drinks out to us, but couldn't take our order or bring us water. No one checked on us either.  If we knew we would have little and bad service, we would have just ordered takeout. I wrote to the restaurant directly before posting here, however I never got a response.  The only shining light was the outside bartender,Jay, who made my husband a second drink that was very good. Very different that our many past experiences.",2020-09-29 19:43:04

Tehy got me a car similar to what I had reserved but in really bad conditions, dirty, very little gas on it, scratched everywhere on the outside, the passenger door did not have the button to open the window, only a hole.
the rubber seal around the trunk was all loose, so when I tried to close it I had to literally take the seal and push it inside the trunk before closing it.
We went to talk to the people for a change of car and they promised us they were gonna call us the same day to go and  get another car and they never did (Emerson Rosales was the contact for the call).

we got the bill. I was dining with my Mom, Nana, Aunts and cousin. We were in town for a wedding so we ordered some mimosas ($7 each on the menu) and Bloody Marys ($8 each).

We remained calm and mentioned the odd charges to our waitress and she wasn't even apologetic. She basically was like well - I thought you knew that! WHAT?

Purchased a 2017 Toyota Sienna van in March 2019 along with a $2000+ ""Gold Star"" warranty.  That was my first mistake.  Discovered later that neither one of the keyfobs worked properly.  Being an automobile technician for 25 years, I replaced both batteries in the keyfobs as that's the first thing you do in these cases. That didn't work so I special ordered the keyfobs then made an appointment to get them replaced and reprogrammed.  (Oh, and I called ahead of time to make sure they were covered by the warranty.  I was assured that they were after the finance manager contacted the service department about them.  That was my second mistake.  The appointment was at 9:30 am.  I arrived early.  Long story short, I was accused of breaking one of the keyfobs and told that the other one worked properly.  I know better.  This problem left me stranded, twice, once in Phoenix!
I was told that one of the keyfobs wasn't covered anyway because it was an aftermarket one.  Hm?!   So, they sold
me this vehicle knowing it had an inoperative aftermarket keyfob and an inoperative Toyota keyfob.  Once again, hmm.
After being juggled between the service advisor to finance manager to customer relations to customer relations manager and back and forth, I finally told them to replace the one keyfob that was ""covered"" by the warranty.  
By now it's 12:30 pm and they said it would take two hours to do the work!  Huh?
So, I went home.  I had already been there for three hours getting tossed around.
Bottom line(s);  don't buy a car here as they forget about you after the sale, don't have your car serviced there as they will find a way to avoid fixing an obvious problem, and don't purchase the Gold Star warranty as between them, the sales department and the service department they will figure out a way to get out of paying for a repair and having the customer pay out of pocket.

MVmNhQuDaPWPdqdxolAyzg,cRzvt4Kt72Sjy52fXSF0Lw,YT1oM3AlNSCjzKvbH8MPWA,1.0,0,0,0,"We came here upon a recommendation from a friend, who really liked Juniper. We went on a Saturday night and the place was very dimly lit for the type of setting and atmosphere. I've been to my share of restaurants and enjoyed meals where the lights were pretty low, but it wasn't exactly consistent with the atmosphere.

After being seated, our server gave us plenty of time before approaching us to take our orders. He was pretty distant and the entree suggestion he gave us was very brief, when we asked.

Both of us went with the fried chicken, one with dark meat and the other with white meat. The wait for our food wasn't terrible and the food looked fantastic when it came out. HOWEVER, the taste was a different story. The mashed potatoes and green beans were INCREDIBLY salty, to the point in which they could not be eaten. I was confused by the green beans because they were done like I would have ordered them from a chinese restaurant. When it came to the chicken, the skin was nice and crispy. My drumstick was fine, but I found my thigh to be pink and bloody in the center. 
Because our neglectful server never checked on us after our food was delivered, we completed our plates to the best of our ability and waited a good 10 minutes before we could flag down our server. I showed him the uncooked piece of chicken and he apologized and took the plate. He came back a few minutes later and asked me what kind of piece I wanted. I told him another thigh would be fine to avoid making things complicated. He told me that thighs are harder to cook and will take longer. I'm not sure why that's relevant... because if he was really concerned about time he wouldn't have ignored us for so long in the first place. Not to mention that the entree is pretty expensive, so that should somewhat justify the difficulty in its preparation.

My second chicken thigh came out and it was served on a small bread plate. As soon as I cut into it, blood and pink meat revealed itself. Mind you, the server didn't bother to check to see if things were done correctly given the previous piece. He just put it down and walked away. Thus, he had no clue that it happened again and didn't really seem to care. The only thing that was consistent was him ignoring us and not checking to see how things were going. By this time, I was so angry and hungry that my dining guest went over and asked for the check and paid for it to avoid my huge complaints.

For a place that sets their entrees at such a price range, it's expected that the service at least be satisfactory even if the food is just mediocre. However, Juniper made it very clear to us that the only thing they are concerned about is setting a high price for crappy food and even crappier service. Maybe the dim lights were to hide the fact that they don't know how to properly cook a chicken thigh, but could they at least not charge $18 for that mess?

I was shocked it was that expensive and they explained they only have one size salad now, which I felt the woman on the phone should've told me when I ordered a small salad. Then, I confirmed with them that there was a side of honey mustard in my bag which they said there was. I get home and open my bag to no side of dipping sauce and my fries are literally wet and soggy. The salad was also not good. I called back because I was generally really unpleased with my experience, and they were rude to me and blamed me for losing the sauce even though I did not drop anything out of the bag before he HUNG UP on me.

Overall, being generous, a D or 2 on a scale of 10.   I went in at 3 and was told out of chicken and ribs, be ready after 3:30.  Went back and ordered 2 plates, each with 2 different meats, and 2 different sides and 2 different side bbq sauces.  Got take out and went home 20 minutes up the road.
Ribs.  Terrible, tough, not like they show in the picture, just very lightly seasoned and presumably smoked.   Not fall-off-the-bone tender, barely cooked, couldn't even chew it off the bone, got more stuck in my teeth than in my stomach.
Chicken. So-so but no flavor, also barely cooked.  
Maybe they did a rush job so they could serve customers, but both of these meats were disappointments.   
Brisket.  Chopped, not sliced (told me in advance).
Pulled pork.  Brisket and pork were side-by -side in a container and I couldn't tell which was pork and which was beef.  Both disappointments.
Bacon Baked Beans.  No bacon pieces and no bacon flavor, had much better from a can.
Creamy Cole Slaw.  Watery not creamy, not to my taste.
Smoked Mac and Cheese.  No smoke flavor and very dry
Mustard Potato Salad.  Potatoes barely cooked beyond raw ( maybe that's the way it's supposed to be) and no real flavor.  Raw potatoes can't absorb flavor.
2 different BBQ sauces in containers were like my sauce experiments gone bad.
Total cost including a $5 tip for counter service was $36.00.  I've had bigger dining disappoints somewhere in California where I lived but can't remember when, but it was in the last century.  If I had more time, I'd tell you how I really feel.  
Sorry for a lousy review for a new restaurant, maybe it's not fair but maybe it'll motivate them to do better.

Low balled me on my trade in then listed it 4K over what they gave me saying that they don't sell ( it sold within a week of being on their website). Then the sales rep messes up on the numbers and I have to pay $951 instead of the $800 that I had been told before. So ok I'll pay it because I don't want to have to make an additional trip back out there on Monday. The sales rep messes up on my paperwork and has to redo it twice. It ended up taking several hours and this is with a pre approval. Then I show the sales rep the email from their dealership saying that if I buy a car I get $100 of an accessory. She tells me that she knows nothing of this and to find out another time because the service department is closed. So I email her the next day then the next day no response. Why because she already got the sale so I mean nothing anymore. So I email the dealership and let them know how I feel. So they must've said something because then she calls me back saying that I need to order the accessory through the service department. Ok then things are finally going my way right? Wrong. I order it then drive out later that day to get it. It's a $100 sun visor for my truck (overpriced I know but hey it's Florida and I need one).

I am a big fan of their food but I recently had a horrible experience and I feel the need to express it. I understand plenty of local business' are financially struggling amid the COVID-19 regulations but I thought the way The Project handled it was not right at all and overall seemed very desperate.  GO TO SANTO MEZCAL OR FLOR DE MAIZ INSTEAD!

This past weekend, a couple of friends came to The Project for some to-go margaritas. We were told we had to order food in order to take the to go orders. Two of us had just ate so were only interested in the drinks, my other friend was planning on getting food. We all ordered separately and made sure to order food as that was what the owner had asked us to do. 
We all ordered tacos as we thought they would be the easiest thing to order. We waited 45-50 minutes for ONE TACO!!! and 4 to go margaritas that were already prepped!
When the owner came back with our receipt, she had entered all of our items into one order. Therefore, two of us had ordered food for no reason as we had a friend ordering food that would allow us to order the to-go margs. It seemed so shady from the owner to have us all order food when she knew we weren't all hungry. Thankfully, she let us know we could cancel two orders of tacos which we did. She came back with our new receipt saying how the register had overcharged us and that she would get a hold of me on Monday (it was Sat) to make sure there was a credit on my statement. Never heard from her until I called in to check in. It took me multiple times to get a call back. The owner then proceeded to tell me that I was undercharged?! I never got a detailed receipt like I had requested at the restaurant. The owner did request my info but I was so over with the back and forth that I just never replied.

Subway doesn't come close; Jimmy John's is interesting, but a different experience altogether, and the various grilled subshops, e.g. Charlie's, etc., aren't a legit East Coast sub alternative. I've eaten at three of the four in my area regularly. All have the same menu and the same premise of a well-designed East Coast sub franchise store. But this particular location leaves much to be desired. For starters, there is the authenticity of the ""Mike's way"" treatment; A thorough slathering of red wine vinegar, oil, and traditional spices. If you get this wrong, you have missed the entire East Coast sub concept and thus resign yourself to another version of Subway. In my opinion, this is unforgivable. This location routinely goes light on Mike's way when it comes to that red wine vinegar treatment. Jersey Mike's corporate marketing campaign even draws attention to the juice dripping off the sandwich as part of Mike's way, but you'll not find any juice dripping anywhere from this location. And let me tell ya, a bunch of meat, even freshly cut, stuck between two pieces of dry bread and covered with a few vegetables does not an East Coast sub make. Indifferent treatment toward customers, almost to the extent of being dismissive of their sandwich desires, is a customer service crime everywhere today, but not at the three other Jersey Mike's locations in the St. Louis area. It is a feature of this one. Bottom line: if you crave an East Coast style sub, go ahead, try Jersey Mike's - it's a great concept restaurant - but avoid the location on Watson and drive out to Chesterfield or over to O'Fallon, Illinois instead. And, if you must stop by the Watson location, oversee the Mike's Way operation, and insist on an ample slathering of red wine vinegar and oil. It truly is a difference maker.",2017-09-09 19:17:26

The chicken was just okay in my opinion, I prefer a crispy crust like Hodak's, but my friend prefers batter so she loved it. I felt it was a little greasy and though it was supposed to be boneless, mine had little bits of bone in it. The sides were amazing, though. My friend got the mac and cheese and she let me try it- hands down the best mac and cheese I've ever had at a restaurant. I regret not getting it. My sides weren't memorable, but the biscuit was yummy.

We also had the handmade sodas- she got the elderflower one and I got a cream soda. We actually ended up switching because we preferred the other, but both were really good! 

Parking is street parking and the entrance is to the left side (it can be pretty confusing when you walk up). There's lots of seating inside and the bar top is a really cool, giant piece of wood. It's got a very log cabin-y feel to it. It looked like they had potential for outdoor seating but it was too cold the day we went so I'm not sure. 

As far as big-picture drawback: The service was just okay- we sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty busy. It seemed like he was a little annoyed with us sitting at the bar when there were plenty of tables around. Also, the prices are quite high for a fried chicken joint to plan accordingly (the 2 piece dinner with a side an biscuit is roughly $15).

After purchasing tickets for me and my son, we went to the concession stand to by popcorn and soda. We stayed in one line and when it was our turn to be served the cashier just left and never returned, without saying anything and then the supervisor came and told me the line was closed. I went to the other line and when it was my turn to order I asked for the supervisor. When I explained to her that the way I was treated wasn't right, she told me that the other line was closed and that there was nothing else that she could have done, I had to go to another line.
I got my popcorn and soda and they were preparing another small popcorn at the time and I told them that was not for us because we only ordered one popcorn and one soda and they just said that they knew it wasn't for us, so we left to watch the movies. When we left the theater, in the car, my son was asking me how much he spent off of his gift card, since he used his gift card at the concession stand. We checked the receipt only to find out that they over charged us for that small popcorn. Kind of fishy, taking in consideration that it was immediately after I had complained about their customer service and I had advised them at the time that the second popcorn wasn't for me at the time of the purchase and they acknowledged it wasn't for me. 
When I went back inside to speak to a manager for my refund, I had to deal with a lot of hostility from the manager who was making it seem like I was over reacting and started to be very disrespectful when I told her that I needed to read my receipts before I sign anything since they already overcharged me once. I asked to speak to her manager about it and she threatened to call the security so I had to call the police myself.  They never bothered to give me an apology. The conclusion is that if you ever dare to speak up when there is a problem, they will try to get you in trouble so they can save their pitiful skins. So sad. This is what happens when there is only one movie theatre in the whole west bank. No competition and crapy service. My friends warned me before that this was a ghetto theater but I never listened.

We ordered appetizers when we first got there and they didn't come out until right before our $41 (yeah, forty one f#^*%ing dollar) pizza which came like forty minutes after we ordered. When I got up to ask where our appetizers were, no one there knew what the hell I was talking about. The pizza was supposed to be a vegan meat lovers pizza. And granted there were bits of meat on it, but everything on the pie was scarce, even the cheese. The knots were microwaved (which I've never seen anyone do, not even back home in NYC) and too doughy/undercooked in the middle. I got charged $4 for a bottled drink that costs $5-$6 for a whole pack. This place to me was honestly a joke. One adult (the owner I presume) and ten 13 year olds running around like chickens with no heads. There were outside kids (I assume friends of the kids working) walking in and out of the business and into the back room the whole time like it was a party or something. Customers that came in hoping to pick up orders they placed prior to getting there had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes on top of the 30-45 minutes they already had (yeah, I asked while we all waited for our food). There were customers that ordered slices that finally gave up and left after waiting a half hour for nothing and had to sort out almost being super overcharged by the owner himself for simple snacks they had while waiting. I don't understand how a place like this stays in business, oh wait.. Yeah I do... Charging $9 for knots and $41 for a pizza people can literally make at home and it'd taste better for about $25. Smh. Oh, and let's not forget about how freakin hot it was in there, the dust caked onto the ceiling fans and walls, the burnt out light bulbs and globs of food that's stuck between the pages of the menus.

First off the staff in both the dining area and kitchen are woefully inadequate. Our waitress was pleasant but the place is pretty big and there were only like 3 waitresses and a busboy working the entire place. At around 20 tables, that's just ridiculous. The kitchen must be understaffed as well. Why else would it take an hour and 15 minutes for 3 burgers, a hot roast beef sandwich and 3 orders of chicken fingers and an additional 20 minutes on top of that for 2 orders of mac and cheese served in a small soup cup with an accompanying cup of tomato soup!?! That is just outrageous.

After an hour and 15 minute wait for a burger you'd think ""wow, this had better be an awesome burger"" - especially since my burger was named the Gourmet burger. The burger and texas toast it came served on was pretty tasty but the toppings that came with it were very sub par. The tomato slices didn't look fresh at all and the lettuce wasn't the leaf, it was from the bottom stalk so it was thick and tasteless. A meager portion of fries came with the burger too and they were just so-so.

Another negative was the glasses of wine we got. At $8 a glass that was without a doubt the weakest pour I have ever been served in my life! There were two of us that got glasses of wine and neither of us could believe how little wine was in our glasses. The glasses weren't even 1/4 full. It was just a little more than comp samples I've been given at other restaurants.   

The menu is pretty limited (it's mostly standard bar food fare), the prices are high for the quantity and quality of the food, the service is pathetic and they seriously skimp on their wine pours. The only thing this place has going for it is that the room is a nice big open space, they have a very long bar and several TV's on the wall.

After ordering banana tempera ($4) I saw on the check it was listed as $8. When I looked over the menu, our waitress explained the ice cream was extra. I enjoyed it, so was willing to pay for it. However, I remarked to my boyfriend  that an 8 dollar dessert wasn't really in my budget, and I didn't understand it was an extra charge since she said 'what kind of ice cream do you want?' rather than 'do you want ice cream?'

Our waitress returned, after overhearing me, and offered to remove the 4 dollars, but said so in a condescending and slightly confrontational tone (complete with eye roll) that made me feel uncomfortable. I declined, but leaving having made felt unwelcome, I asked for a manager on the 1st floor to let them know.

I got out of work early and I couldn't make it to my usual nail tech so I decided to go somewhere quick and get a simple fresh set. Little did I know I was about to get FUCKED HARD. (In the worst way possible might I add). I entered and the place was swarming with children everywhere, which I don't mind I love kids! But they were literally destroying the property and the workers didn't say anything. Okay cool w.e this is not my business, not my property, y'all go head. After waiting, for what seemed like forever, I was finally able to be seated and start my fresh new set. Mind you I already had on press on nails so I asked the lady if I could simple soak my nails for 2-3 mins so the nails can slip off. She immediately told me no and said that she can file it off. My naive ass listened to this deranged woman and let her file off my press on nails. That's my first mistake. This lady filed the press on nails off but filed so hard that my nail bed was so soft and completely sensitive. I informed her that she was hurting me but she literally ignored me and continue. I had to legit pull my hand away from her and demand her to go softer. As we proceed to add the acrylic she applies a HEAVY THICK load onto my nail bed. I kept quite and let her continue to see if she'll buffer it down and file the shape to make it sharp. Ladies and gentleman she did the exact opposite. Left the thick amount of acrylic on my nail, BARELY filed it to a sharp square shape and told me to pay before she applies the polish. I laughed and said ""Are you serious? This is it? You're done?"" And she looked at me with a determined face saying yes! Y'all...this is when I knew I fucked up by coming here. It's clear as day that these workers are not updated in up to date nail etiquette. They're very old fashioned, non professional and clearly don't give two shits about their quality of work. I ended up being the professor to a student and showing her past pictures of my precious nail jobs and showing her how PRECISE the filing is. She tried again, maybe even her best shot within her 90 years of living, but it still wasn't GIVING! I asked for the manager to step in and rectify this nonsense on my nail bed labeled as a ""Fresh set"". The owner takes over and continues to file down, adds the polish and says done! I'm in utter shock and disarray...the pictures I have attached are finished product these people believed in their heart of hearts was top tier quality! It's saddening and also sickening to know that they are profiting off of individuals like this. Putting out improper and lazy sets for people and getting away with it. I literally had to sit there with them and teach them how to file nails properly and my nails STILL look like shit. I told them I'm not paying for this full price and they caught an attitude with me. I am the customer. At least I thought I was but after today I've realized I was actually the victim. These people need to pay for what they're doing to people and the women who specifically took advantage of me need to be locked up and I will gladly throw away the keys. I will die a hero before I live long enough to see myself in this establishment ever again. If you know what's good for you, PLEASE save yourself the trip AND the money.

I got a night guard from this place.  A few things went wrong: 

- They told me while I was in the dentist's chair that it was awesome that my insurance covered my night guard, and that it was only ~$50!  I got to the front desk and saw that they were going to charge me much more - I believe it was around $150 or so.  Good thing I checked without just mindlessly swiping my credit card - I asked why they had a different price than what they had told me, the front desk double checked, and said that they made a mistake.  My question here: What would they have done if I didn't check?  

- After I went to do the night guard impression, they said it would be 4-8 weeks before I could come get it.  I had it in my calendar to check around weeks 6 and week 10 to make sure I didn't forget.  I called during week 6 and they said it wasn't ready yet, that's totally fine.  I called during week 10 - they said that they had one that had been sitting around, and was probably mine and did I want to come in to see? Really?  My questions here: What would have happened I didn't check? Why didn't they follow through with finding who the night guard belonged to instead of waiting for someone to call in to ask? 

- I went in to try the night guard, and they said that it was most definitely mine, but something about it didn't fit.  I had to do at least another TWO night guard impression/fittings before it finally fit.  My question here is: Really?  :(  

I also supposedly had a chip in my tooth. 

- They fixed it - and a few days later, I felt something break, and was pretty sure it was the fix they put in.  They said, come back in, we'll get it fixed.  They looked at it and said that if they kept on fixing it, it would just keep breaking because of my bite or something.

Giant has gotten rid of a lot of real ingredient food products. It's great if you like ultra-processed, shelf-stable, convenience food. Dear God they sell shelf-stable bacon!

Worse than the selection is the utter lack of customer service. Many of the employees are hold-overs from Genuardi's. Management, however, seem to be new, and apparently customer satisfaction is not an incentive at Giant.

Online order set for plenty of time to prep.  2 kids build your owns, a burrito, tacos, chips, guac and queso.

First issue.  Picked up two bags on shelf and went about my business.  Left the restaurant.  Rested one on my arm and held one.  Got in truck and set on floor.  Had some liquid on my arm and asked my wife if something was leaking.  She lifted the bag and it blew out and food went everywhere.

Turned around and went back to store.  Told them what happened and they made a new barbacoa build your own.  They put in bag sideways and not flat and that was what happened the first time.  The bag stood on shelf.  Not layed on its side.  I told them that's what caused it.

Second issue.  Got home and unpacked food to discover the guacamole and queso was missing.  The 2 large chips were regular by comparison.  Items paid for.

Got children eating and son was halfway through his burrito and discovered a hair in his food.

A discouraging dinner experience to say the least.

Have been coming to this location pretty frequently and have had issues before.  This was the one time I thought appropriate to say something.tj",2020-11-24 03:31:39

A 1-star rating really is too generous and mostly overturned by the good quality of the fresh produce. If it were for the service, or lack of, it should receive ""-10"" stars. The staff was rude and acting angry for whatever reason. There was an internet glitch at the time we were checking out, my CC wouldn't get processed despite of my signing off etc. I was asked to swipe my card again, not with apologies, but with demanding words and angry tone of voice from the young woman cashier. When I questioned if I would be double charged, she looked me as if she could shoot me had she has a gun in her hand. I followed her demand and signed the 2nd time. Without ever looking at me, she then handed a receipt of the total amount that I spent rather than the normal long strip of itemized receipt, and was told that I had to go to the custom service to get it and subjected to be charged again. I then walked over to cashier #1, which was supposed to be the ""custom service"", a man or a woman (can't tell) snared at me and demanded to empty my items and go through scanning again if I wanted the itemized receipt, and in the meantime offered to lecture about what an internet service provider is and telling me that Verizon is one of them that provides the service. All through this whole ordeal, no one ever said ""sorry"" or ""thank you"", which would be expected anywhere else. But I guess it is not in the staff's vocabulary when they deal with customers, only snare, angry stare or no looking at all. We left the store feeling insulted and mad, and swear that would be our last trip there ever. If a business wants to be successful, it must learn the art of custom service.

I got the rare beef pho and I feel like they Americanized it or something. I didn't taste or smell any cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, anise, nothing. The broth just wasn't great. The sad basil and cilantro they gave me didn't fix anything. Probably because the basil leaves were like 1mm long and the cilantro had brown spots all over it. They gave me one lime wedge that was also brown. Added all these things into the broth hoping it would make it better but no. There was also something weird about the noodles. It just makes me think they bought some beef stock and noodles from the grocery store and whipped something up. They also gave me a side of what I thought was hoison and sriracha mixed together but it was way too spicy for my tastes. I wish they would've just given me the packets to mix myself because the actual beef was pretty decent so I would've enjoyed dipping it in that at least. 
Also got the shrimp spring rolls. Those were good and the peanut sauce they had was better than most places.
Tried the honeycomb pandan cake too. Not good. It tasted like they cooked it way too long and/or its like 3 days old. Very hard.

The food is not bad, but because of the high reviews, I had high hopes for some delicious Mexican food here similar to the ones I've had in Mexico, Southern California, Texas, and Oregon. I'm not sure why, but the East and Midwest can't produce good mexican food. They all taste similar. Maybe it's a regional thing, but nothing I've had was above average.

Here the service is nice and all, but the food was alright.
I got a carne asada burrito with guacamole on the side. The guacamole was too watery with barely any avocados and just huge chunks of tomatoes. It was a waste of 2.75 for me. The burrito had beans, rice, pico de gallo, carne asada, and sour cream. I thought the beans tasted like reheated canned beans or something. The carne asada was sorta dry and just didn't taste right. The total was like 10.80. In my opinion that's sort of steep for ""authentic"" mexican food. If it was delicious I wouldn't mind paying. Some of the best Mexican food is probably 5 or 6 dollars packed with much more in Socal.

It's all my opinion because people here seem to love it, but if you've grown up used to Mexican food in the West coast and Mexico, then probably most or all of the Mexican food in the East won't satisfy you.",2011-05-08 21:47:03

Given tonight's online carry out order experience, I will not return to this Bravo location, ever. Talk about a cluster - you know what.  If I was managing this restaurant, I would've been absolutely embarrassed by my front-end service people representing this establishment.
Looooonnggg story short (not so much), the Bravo to-go person couldn't manage a simple sale from their kiosk Bravo to-go register and had to go get a manager's 'card'. Then, upon his return and communicating my order total for approximately $40 and receiving my cash payment of $100, immediately responded that he couldn't possibly handle that so he had to walk away yet again. Upon returning, he discovered the cash register drawer had NO MONEY in it. Um, how did he previously know that he couldn't possibly change a $100 bill??? A gentleman (assuming a member of management) showed up with a 'stocked' cash register drawer and provided me with a shallow apology for my wait. Empty apologies are worthless.
In between my come and go encounters with the Bravo to-go server, I specifically asked for some fresh-grated parm to be included with my order. When he finally delivered my order, I asked if the fresh grated parm was included to which he responded, ""You wanted fresh grated parm and not powder form, right?"" I kid you not, I bit my tongue so that I would not voice what was my brain was thinking ... "" Um, how many requests do you get for fresh powder form parm?"" 
Sincerely, a cluster 'F' experience from start to finish. Never again. And do you know what I remembered on my drive home?

I understand and I informed the front desk that I'd like to keep my bags on site and will just walk around a bit and wait at the lobby since the lady said it would be quick and they'll call me (they asked for my cell). After 3 hours or watching the lady looking over at me and allowing all new people walking in to go get rooms, I decided to walk over and ask what the story was. Come to find out, they did have my room and just didn't bother to call.

The only good thing right now is that the busboy is a good guy, I'm here now. I'm leaving tomorrow. I am giving this place 1 star and will update it tomorrow after I leave. Another plus is it has a pool but my room is facing a brick wall (so that nulls out the extra star).

Something you'll need to know. The floor plan is like a giant capital G with the center as the pool, the elevators are at the top of the letter G and other end of the letter G. The only elevator you can use is the one at the end center of the G, the top one is the service elevator and only for the hotel service people. 

This  means if you're on a floor higher than the first, you need to walk all the way in a circle around all the floors on that floor before you get to the elevator with all your baggage, you can cut through things if you don't mind taking the stairs and carrying your heavy bags down the stairs. And if you're with someone who is elderly, it'll be a hoot trying to explain to them why you can't just go directly to the elevator across from your room to go downstairs.

In fairness, I didn't take whatever constitutes the free tour. I never entered the building itself. My oldest friend now lives in Philadelphia, a city which I'm not really very familiar with, and I visited him there recently. He lives near this historic area, and after lunch, we took a walk around. I'm impressed and fascinated by history; any history, large or small...whether its the Pharoahs of ancient Egypt, Imperial Rome and the emperors, the Medici family and the Renaissance, the discovery of the Fayum mummy portraits, Lenin and the emergence of Communism in Russia, Ulysses S. Grant at Vicksburg, the Weimar Republic of Germany and how its failure helped usher in the emerging horrors of Hitler and Nazism, the struggle of Ireland against British tyranny, the barbarity of Leopold II of Belgium in Africa, Billie Holiday and Miles Davis playing jazz in Harlem, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, Legs Diamond monopolizing the bootleg booze trade in the Catskills during Prohibition, the Lincoln County Wars of the late 1870s and Billy the Kid getting shot down in New Mexico by Pat Garrett...well, as I was trying to say, in my own long-winded way--- any history, large or small, American or international, can work for me, and be of interest.

My friend pointed out a variety of historic buildings to me, and explained briefly why they were historic. I was interested and appreciative. But, in fairness, I probably wasn't in the best frame of mind to take his impromptu tour. It was hot, and I was distracted. I went out with a young lady years ago in a West Philadelphia suburb, and had occasionally ventured into the city itself way back when, but that was many moons ago. I felt uncomfortable in a city I really didn't know, wasn't familiar with. I worried about the parking garage I had parked my car in-- I had visions of that crappy reality TV show-- ""Parking Wars."" Am I gonna get towed by some over-zealous geek with a little bit of authority and ""reality TV"" credentials, despite the fact that I'm in a supposedly ""legit"" parking garage? How much am I gonna get soaked for parking there? And if I do get towed, am I gonna have to pay an arm and a leg to get my car back? Am I gonna be able to make my way onto Rt. 95 before that brewing thunderstorm hits? My night vision is bad-- will I be able to make it back to Jersey before nightfall? Whatever happened to my ex-girlfriend?

Then my friend interrupted my neurotic, self-absorbed musing and asked, ""Wanna see the Liberty Bell?"" ""Ah...yeah, ok. Sure."" ""You never saw it?"" ""Never was in this part of Philly before. Ever."" We walked over to a building, looked through a window at the iconic bell with the crack in it. Two security guards stood on the opposite side of the bell, watching us warily (or so it seemed). There were several buttons you could push on the wall running alongside the window where we stood, each button representing a different language that gave a recorded, capsulized history of the bell. We stood a little while, wanting to be properly respectful (although I couldn't resist pushing the button to hear the recorded history lesson in Chinese), and then left to make way for a cluster of tourists.

As we walked, I asked, ""Isn't Ben Franklin buried near here?""

""Yeah? Probably, but don't ask me where.""

We headed back. At one point, we passed a restaurant that purportedly serves the same food that people in the late 1700's ate. The idea intrigued me until I saw the prices and the fact that tofu is on the menu. I don't think George Washington and Ben Franklin ate tofu. And they didn't pay $40 for steak and shrimp. I don't know if the Liberty Bell itself cost $40 back then.

Obviously, Philadelphia is loaded with history. The men who founded this country, flawed individuals all, nonetheless came up with a genius concept (borrowing a page or 2 from Greek philosophy) that was basically unprecedented in history-- the formation of a country where there wasn't an entrenched caste system, a country where someone could start out with nothing and by virtue of innate talent and skill achieve excellence and move into a position of prominence and benevolent power, where true Democracy and freedom had a chance to develop. Yes, they were too often slave owners, and exploiters, and had an elitist sensibility, but human beings are complex, and so is their history.

So...I need to come back and spend more than a few hours exploring Philadelphia's history. That's obvious. It's a rich history, and multi-faceted.

But...with all due respect...the Liberty Bell is an old bell with a crack in it. By all means, see it. But it won't take a lot of time to do that.",2019-09-03 03:14:47

We asked for a plate for the kids so we could put a few falafel balls on each kids plate.
""NO"".
Excuse me?
""No, we dont give out plates"". 
So what should the kids eat on? 
""I dont know, maybe the tin foil or a napkin"". 
What'?!?!?! 
We weren't interested in a whole fight so we did that. Put the little falafel peices on a napkin that all rolled on the already dirty (not wiped down between customers) table. 
We asked for cups so we could share a drink. They give 2. I ask for 2 more. I get 2 more with a nasty dirty look.
So after our table is a huge mess from us eating bec there are no trays and only 1 plate given for 5 people, we pile all the food up on the center plate and start to walk out. The shorter guy with tatoos comes over and says hey! how come you didnt clean up!? The whole store is quiet and watching this. I say, well there's no tray, only one plate, why should i bother getting all dirty when you dont care about the mess? He yells, everyone cleans up, now you clean up! My wife was in the bathroom and I had to wait for her anyways so I just did it because I was mortified and had to wait there anyways.

While I was in line getting tickets, my wife bought the refreshments. What an absolute waste that Harkins uses high-quality plastic cups as disposable cups. How about the cheap paper ones that are compostable?

Waited outside of hotel nearly an hour early. Bus (that was never identified with company name and different than the shuttle that brought us) supposedly picked everyone up on other end of valet. No text, no call, no email, nothing. Called multiple times to see what was going on and got the run around numerous times. Finally asked to walk across to other hotel for bus to pick us up. Ran across busy street only to watch it not wait and pull away again. An absolute joke of customer service, wasted money on a ride we never received and no follow up or service recovery. Not even a sorry.
A couple insights from someone who works in healthcare patient experience:
1) EXPLICITLY state in email where EXACT pick up locations at EACH hotel along with EXACT pick up time windows with photo of shuttle/bus being utilized for the ride.
2) Place your organization branding name and logo on every vantage point of vehicle
3) Give text alert or phone call updates (why even take my phone number down if you won't utilize it?)
4) Consider giving your phone staff customer service training on how to best talk to and manage customer calls
5) And most importantly, follow-up with some form of service recovery other than a, ""Too bad, we already got your money"" attitude. We utilize the AHEART model at my organization and would have done wonders in this situation. I visit Tahoe often and thankfully have great status at the casino resort I stayed at.

9_nBg_Sw4pDQM_Xdc6SFQA,AabFLAqGWIinwWkpqPGWtQ,6c8eIawbCBu3FLp2kDraBA,2.0,1,2,0,"My experience dining here was honestly a joke. This restaurant has a ""fashionable dress code"" that they enforce which I find laughable, because any guest going to a nice bar or restaurant knows how to dress appropriately for the occasion, and the fact that this dress code was posted in multiple places just struck me as very déclassé. If your restaurant warrants nice attire, you won't have to tell people. 

This leads me to my second point of annoyance. The wine and water were served out of plastic ""glasses""...the very same lounge that requires ""fashionable"" attire can't even do the least and use actual glass?

The salad I ordered was enjoyable and while I wasn't expecting an entree size, I have to admit I was taken aback by how little food I was getting for $10. The rose brut was very nice and service was fine. 

And lastly, the interior design of this place is so bizarre and disjointed. The live plants compete with fake plants and the sleek, modern decor is met with an almost rustic bar backdrop that has random tchotchkes on the top shelf. 

All in all, a very strange place that I don't recommend visiting.",2019-09-26 23:24:26

We then moved to the entrees.  I had Pasta Curry.  The spices were nice and the portion was generous.  i would give this dish a B.  My wife had the Seafood Trio.  The dish was not prepared with the items as stated on the menu.  For some reason, the chef substituted red snapper for salmon.

It was our anniversary dinner, and we went there with great confidence because as you can tell by my other review I just love the place. However, I guess we all make mistakes and the illustrious Inn is no exception. My husband ordered the captain steak, which is a huge piece of meat, with all the fixings. There was just one small problem - he got the steak all right, but not a single fixing. That meant no salad, no potato, no side. He just kept waiting for them to bring the rest of his dinner out, but they never did.  He is not one to call attention to others' mistakes, so he said nothing and just quietly paid the bill. It is our guess that the server was quite new, as she seemed somewhat nervous, but if that is the case then someone with more experience should've been watching.

Their stock was floor-to-ceiling and guaranteed to tempt. It was a sure-fire 4 star experience with some variable and slightly rocky staffing issues. (There were a few surly moments with obviously stressed staffers...but I couldn't figure out why they were stressed?) 

But my last few visits to Rosie's have been disappointing. What used to be a wonderland is now gappy with lots of holes around the store. The range of affordable workhorse yarns up to the luxe treasures has changed dramatically. Luxe and remarkable are no longer available at Rosie's. Loop has passed them by and stolen away most of their remarkable inventory. 

Or maybe Rittenhouse Fibers distribution has taken the owner's focus away from her retail front. I don't know. But I don't like it, let me tell you. I used to recommend Rosie's as a tourist destination and a little powerhouse of a yarn store. (So! Much! Wonderful! Yarn! Crammed! In! A! Tiny! Space!) The marvel of a tiny store with so much to offer was utterly wonderful. What was--at one time--a marvelously curated collection of yarns for every knitter's needs is now a collection of yarns that have been left behind. 

Not worth the visit, and I lament the loss of such a treasure.

When picking up the car, first the guy told me it would be $900. Um excuse me? He said it was for insurance of the car only after I asked why so much. He was ready to charge me the extra without even explaining. He did fix the price (because my car insurance covers rentals) and it was the expected price.

A week later I return the car to TPA and the woman checking the car back in says, ""Your total is $675 is that correct?"" Again, no, that is not correct. We looked over the itinerary and she said, ""You were charged $100 for a premium car is that correct?"" No, no I did not select a premium car and the guy who gave me the car didn't say the car was a ""premium"" car. Again, she was able to help me and deduct that extra $100 charge and I paid what I expected to pay but wow, what a joke! You try and add on things left and right and if people aren't certain what they booked the car at, you're robbing them! Where did this mysterious $100 fee come from when I returned the car? Basically, thin air. I'm not pleased about that. 

I should also mention that I used a credit card when picking up the car and a few days later, my card was used to purchase $1500 worth of airline tickets in Atlanta. Coincidence? Perhaps.

Outward appearance- it's in the French quarter, so it's drab on the outside and looks exactly like you saw after the Katrina hurricane- dirty looking, dusty, and cramped. It does not look all ""cutesy"" as the photos on website show. There were very few travelers photos that I saw, just stock photos. 

Lobby- clean and cramped. Front desk staff was nice but seemed overworked. The same people who checked you in were the ones parking cars and helping with luggage.  Jacks and Jills of all trades. 

Cleanliness- NOT clean rooms!  First room there were ROACHES by the door when we turned around to go out to get the rest of our luggage. They moved us to a room that has windows right by the street. We barely got any sleep the 3 nights we were there. New room was not much better. There was so much dust above the door sills and on the base boards!!  It appeared to not have been dusted in years!  Please see pictures. Even the Kleenex dispenser had dust on it.  Management tried to convince us that it was because they have to keep the doors open when cleaning. No way!  Not for that thick dust. My sister and I were sneezing all night. The manager said she would send a humidifier to the room but it never showed and we didn't see her again. The towels were a little dingy, carpets had stains and walls were dirty. Nothing a little Lysol and a towel couldn't have cleaned, but the fact is that they did not do it.

Ease/security- was not easy to maneuver through the hotel. Yes, it's old French and is much smaller and goes with the close style of homes of the French quarters but the hotel was a maze.  Didn't feel very secure. The door leading out of our room was right by a major exit which then exited right onto the street. Most of the homes appeared to be this way, but other hotels in the area seemed to have exits only by the lobby, not by the individual resident rooms. 

Parking- the ""secure"" lot was a cramped gravel alley where the cars were packed in so tight together. They claimed to have security cameras, but I saw none when I walked the ""lot.""  Parking is about $45 a night; quite pricey for an ill-secured reserved space. You would come out better parking on an adjacent street and just walking everywhere. Street ""cleaning"" was on Thursday and they towed any cars left on street, so watch out for that if you're there on a Thursday and decide to street park. They were pretty speedy with getting the vehicle from the lot and they did an excellent job of maneuvering our large SUV out with not a scratch. 

Workers- depends on the moment of their friendliness. They will smile in your face and then the next minute talk to their coworkers about you asking for items/service to make your stay more accommodating. I witnessed this on several occasions when I was waiting at the front desk and someone may have been complaining about their room being cleaned.  There was one set of workers in particular that worked around 6pm that were the best. The others changed moods with the wind.

Breakfast- cheap. Powdered eggs, rubbery sausage or extra greasy bacon, spongy bread/bagels. No extra care taken to make breakfast look nice. They just dump it in the serving trays and all the hungover folks just have at it. It was a sight to see in the mornings. Lol. I sat and sipped tea after seeing how greasy the food was the first day. Oh, no fruit, but it was supposed to be a ""full breakfast"" as described on the website.  Breakfast area is right by the front desk, so it was very cramped with minimal seating. Breakfast, or morning snack, was from 7-10 am daily. 

Closeness to Bourbon-  was not too far or a walk. We enjoyed the sights along the way. We found a good parking spot around the corner from bourbon after we came from dinner. 

Amenities- the BEDS WERE HARD. It was not comfortable at all. The soaps and shampoos/lotions were alright. Typical hotel commodity. Everything in the room looked drab. Air did not function well at night. It got very humid in the room and I was hot and uncomfortable. The fan was old and made a lot of noise. Was not very effective to help cool the room. There was an old brick fireplace in the room. Went with the decor but everything just looked old and depressing. 

Overall experience-  wouldn't stay here ever again and wouldn't suggest it to anyone either. Best served staying at a hotel right off bourbon or get one of the major hotels (Waldorf, Sheraton, Harrah's, Marriot, etc).  They are really not too much of a price difference.",2017-06-23 01:22:32

You will NOT BE HELPED HERE. it doesn't matter if there are ten people ahead of you or if you are the only person in line at the drive thru.

They will try to tell you that they are understaffed, but I've worked in fast food. Even if there is only one person in the entire store, a Burger and a drink should take 5 minutes tops to make. Stay clear of this franchise. Drive to the Ridley Park one on macdade blvard, 4 minutes away. Driving there plus waiting with 5 cars ahead of you at the other store will cost you no more than 10 minutes of your time. UBEREATS/DOORDASH/GRUBHUB customers and drivers, BOYCOTT this store.

To the heavyset male bartender, my comment is that you'd be done if you worked for me.

This post is based on 30 years in the restaurant business in the Philly area and count Dmitri's as a go to.

I don't look at checks by detail. I pay them.

To chase me down the road and accuse me of not paying my ""Full"" bill is insane. I paid the full bill! Tipped pretty well on top. I never look at the detail. I look at the total. I get comp'd drinks all the time so I just pay my bill. To then tell me I owe you an extra $19.00 is insane. I gave you $20.00 right on Pine Street after you chased us and was soooo embarsed in front of M. 

As we were getting the car from the parking garage.....That is how much we're willing to go here....I start thinking.......$19.00 is too much and I'm pissed and walk back. 

Upon arrival back you were still talking movies, and I ask for a detailed receipt. This is when you put in for a round of drinks. And wouldn't you know the total was $16.00 and not $19.00. Surcharge? Why weren't the drinks on the bill? There was cash on the bar. 20% wasn't enough for poor service and no knowledge of the menu?

Would that money I gave you on the street would have made it to the register if I hadn't come back and asked for a receipt?

Man you'll never work for me!

I should say that I live less than 2 miles from the place and I think it's intended for the folks who will eat their once on a family trip and will get a kick out of singing servers and will pick something up at the giftshop on the way out--obviously, I was sad to see Apple Bees (though not the best) replaced with mediocre food--food that even good sangin' can't make enjoyable.  

The server was very attentive..took my order and swore everything on the menu was wonderful.  I love fresh smoked ribs and love Memphis style dry rub ribs the most--so that's what I ordered.  When they arrived at the table, they were mush--they didn't just slide off the bone, they were fatty mush on the bone.  I also found it rather odd that their dry rub ribs were in fact, wet--served with lots of BBQ sauce.  I took one bite and couldnt deal with the fat.  I asked the server if I had gotten the right item and he knew immediatly that I was referring to the fact that they weren't DRY rub ribs.  He said that their dry rub ribs are served wet.. (I will pause so everyone can let that sink in--huh?)

Obvioulsy, I wasn't terribly impressed this answer.  He said that was a common complaint--again...not terribly impressed.  I wasn't really in the mood to eat dinner after this so I sent the ribs back and ordered Dolly Parton's Banana Pudding.  Dolly Parton would not be impressed either.  The menu listed the item as a delicious banana pudding with a warm baked meringue.  It was vanilla pudding in a wine glass with chopped up bananas, crunchy nilla wafers and the stuff on top--not even the manager could tell me what it was.  It wasn't really whipped topping and it wasn't meringue--it was some sort of frosting.  I asked her if it was meringue and if it was baked--""no--it doesn't appear to be"" to both questions.  It's not that it tasted terrible (it was as good as something you would get served at a conference rubber chicken meal)--it was that it wasn't anything close to what was advertised.

The manager was very apologetic and admitted that they had some quality issues and offered to take the ribs of my ticket--very generous of her considering I only ate two bites before sending them back. She also admited that the banana pudding was not correct and was not anything close to what is mentioned on the menu--but she still charged me.  

This to me, is the nail in the coffin.  Bad food AND bad customer experience and then to have to pay for the joy of hearing a server sing a B- version of a Garth Brooks song--no thanks.  I won't be back ""y'all.""",2011-08-26 20:45:37

We came with a group of 7 so you would think we would be treated well since we were obviously going to spend a lot...nope. We were given a small squished table in the back right next to the shuffle board. It was made for 4 people. We asked to be moved when a larger table opened up and needless to say I never saw that hostess again and we were there for 3 hours. 
We asked to play shuffle board as soon as we sat down since we were literally on top of it. The waitress said ok. It took FOREVER to get drinks. We barely saw our waitress and when we did she was obviously in a rush and looking down so no one would ask her for anything. During our 3 hours there we got 2 rounds of drinks total and the second one we had to complain for. That's ridiculous. And once we ordered they took 20 minutes to come out and they forgot two of our orders. And one they just brought her last order when she wanted something new. 
We asked our waitress three more times for the shuffle board. She said she couldn't find the pieces. Few minutes later another group of people come up with pieces from the manager and start playing. We state that we've been waiting here for two hours for it and he says we should have asked our waitress and gives them the game. Our waitress when we finally grabbed her, said she was sorry and gave us a round for free.
So 3 hours there only 2 drinks and no game and the worst part was no one that worked there even cared.

1) We left our keys here. We called the day we purchased and found out they fell on a couch. We were told by Nick that he would get them fedexed out asap and he'd give us a call to let us know they were mailed. Nothing. 
2) We called back 2 days later to see if our keys were mailed. They weren't. Nick said he was waiting for the manager and he'd call us back. Nothing 
3) We left another message 4 days after our initial visit, we were told the keys would be mailed out and if they couldn't make it they'd send the day of the delivery. 
4) delivery day. Exactly One week later. Delivery guys show up, no keys in hand. They delivered a 3 seater and a 2 seater. They didn't bring the legs for the couches. So our couches are sitting very low on our floor. They say don't worry before we leave we'll call our tech and tell you when he can bring those. 
5) they take off and don't give us any info. We call, they say we'll call you back in an hr. Nothing. 
6) 3 hours later, we call the store and ask about our keys. No one knows what we're talking about. The manager says he was never aware of this but will try and help us out. 
7) We call back again for the delivery guys to find out when they can bring the legs of the couches because we were told they only. Come. Out here twice a month. I am not waiting 2 weeks because they screwed up. Period. 
8) We call back yet again because no one is returning any of our messages. They can't bring the legs for our couches for another week. They don't give a time they can come till day of. And I have a Dr appt that day. 
9) We still don't know if and when our keys will be sent back to us. I was told they would be sent out several times now. So who knows when we're getting them. After this review I bet they'll delay or even longer. 
So we got great fantastic customer service when we initially walked in those doors. The second they had our money, it all went downhill. Like we didn't matter anymore. They just didn't care anymore. We spent over $1,500. They could have paid $5 to mail us our keys. We live an hour and a half away and could not drive right back on our own. Horrible communication, horrible customer service.

But the veg is almost always on its last legs and the milk is usually near its sell-by date.

Someone mentioned the baklava - totally old and soggy. Almost anything you get here seems like stuff another establishment got rid of. Yeah, there are some pre-packaged things from DiBruno Bros, but they're not cheap and not enough variety to be a draw. There is inevitably one or more employee sitting outside smoking.

First of all the parking.  Every time I go to this location I feel I'm going to get hit in the parking lot.  It's convoluted to get in and out of this place, and the location of the fuel station makes it a death trap.  People cut you off trying to turn in for fuel.

In typical Costco fashion they are constantly moving merchandise around, with no directory, and no personnel around to direct you to anything.  The seafood kiosk is hit and miss - I love to buy fresh mussels, but I never know whether they'll have the kiosk open or not.

Ever try and find the reading glasses?  I swear they move them around just to tick people off.  Sometimes by the Rx glasses, sometimes by the magazine rack, sometimes way over by the garden stuff - take a guess.

They have a good selection of booze and wine at this location, good fresh produce and very good meat.  One of the few places I can find really good lamb.

The food court is a torture chamber.  You pick up your food outside, then have to balance your food on your nose to open the doors to the food court.  Once inside the noise level is excruciating - it echoes like a cavern.

Instead he had his employee /son Robert apologize and then tell me Marty refuses to take responsibility.  Then in the meantime Marty has Added new padding and poles to properly guide cars in so that this might not occur again.  He also refused to view his multiple camera system and claimed he doesn't have ANY footage.  Don't take the chance he won't stand behind any damages even after we discussed it and I wasted time to get the estimates.

lHnVo6dwCARYEX3sqPxgjA,-bFzSRbG5tX-s_UbJ-SyLA,BDue9WNaX46-oNbEMBYUUQ,1.0,1,0,0,"I have a simple requirement when I go out to eat on Date night(every thursday). I expect to be greeted...and then have a desire for someone to come to the table at some point. On my last thursday date, I searched hard for a place that was different  than our usual close by fare. I like to take my wife to somewhere special each week and celebrate our good fortune to have found each other. 

I drove us a hearty distance from our Fishers location to 52nd and College - but I was truly excited by what I read on the internet. But just like my friends would say, ""Don't believe all you rad on the internet."" We found a place to park..though at peak time to eat we expected things to be busy. All other local eateries were packed. When venturing inside...2 tables were filled outside...though we figured with rain close by..we'd try a table inside. But getting inside the place was sparse and empty...during the rush hour...strange?

No one greeted us at the door though we stood there a few moments waiting thinking surely someone would come to us. One woman came in from seeing the people outside..a waitress...but never said a peep. So..thinking we should sit - we picked a table...and sat down...as some woman..with purple hair came out and without words seemed to agree it was ok where we sat. Then she disappeared. The experience then seemed to go into a freakish dream sequence...the kind where everything goes really slow...and you can't get away from some bad happening fast enough. In the next sequence a woman came out to clean a table that had a few glasses empty sitting on it, from a previous unfortunate couple. 

What we watched was a bit unsettling. The tables had silverware wrapped in nice cloth napkins...and when you think the woman is going to pick things up, she actually grabbed on of the silverware wraps that was unused and started wiping the table with it - but then...starts acting like she is going to reset the table with the same sets of silverware. Upon noticing us watching, the young lady grabbed up the stuff and went back to the kitchen. 

So then we waited...5 minutes passing...10 minutes passing...and then 15 minutes passing. No waitress...no water...no drink order...no be with you in a second comment. Nothing. 

So...is the food good? Can't say. But if the food is great...the service definitely sucks. I'd like to have given them the benefit of the doubt. But who knows if they ever would have served us. It was not like they were busy. There was one actually customer still there when we left. 

Moral of the story...the internet is not the equal of word of mouth commentary. It's too easy to pay a company to spray fake comments on sites on the web to get folks to come in the door. But if I do show up - I at least want the people there to offer the simplest of services...like take my order.  My wife and I both consider this the very worst attempt at date night since we have been together...

Side note - 4 close by eateries were so packed there was not even parking to go in the door...so someone knows how to get folks in the door.",2017-06-24 14:50:53

I ordered Chipotle yesterday for pickup. Me being a dummy I forgot my mask, so I called and a worker was nice enough to run my order out. I really appreciated that.

I drove 20 minutes home to eat my food and when I got home, literally NOTHING in my order was right. Should I have checked it before we left? Maybe. But this isn't Mcdonald's and Chipotle has never messed up my order.

My boyfriend got his quesadilla which you'll see below and he loved it.

AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PICTURE, I ordered a kids meal. 2 crispy tacos with steak, veggies, and cauliflower rice. I literally received a quesadilla (I don't think thats steak? Not sure) with rice, hot sauce, and sour cream. Not a single thing I ordered was right besides my kids chips and side of guacamole.

I don't really know what happened here. Did they put my label on the wrong order? Did some poor guy trying the quesadilla for the first time get a kids meal? I want to refuse to believe that someone was that lazy or wasn't looking and actually made that when they read mine. It HAD to be a mistake.

Luckily, I ate it and enjoyed it. Quesadilla for the win!!

However, this review gets low stars because for someone who is on a diet, is a picky eater, or has allergies- this could've been a serious issue. I was so upset at first I almost drove 20 minutes back but I realized it wasn't worth it and to just enjoy what I had. I wasn't charged for a quesadilla so might as well take advantage!

I was told wonderful things about the staff and that I would be in good hands so I trusted my friends opinion. During my initial visit I was told I had a cracked tooth that was infected and I needed to have a root canal procedure. The dentist who told me this spent less than 2 minutes with me before diagnosing me with a root canal. I was quoted about $2000 for the root canal procedure alone (w/ out insurance). I was also told by their periodontist that I had minor gum disease and needed a deep cleaning on all 4 quadrants of my mouth which would cost another $1000-$1500 all together. The staff proceeded to tell me that if I didn't get these procedures done my teeth would fall out! I was terrified! I did not want to lose my teeth. After I had told family the news, I was encouraged to get a 2nd opinion & I am so happy I did. When I went to another dentist (did not tell him anything about d.d.'s recommendations) he told me that in his professional opinion, the problem tooth was just a bad cavity and all I needed was a filling. Not at any point did the other dentist say that the tooth was even close to needing a root canal. He also told me that my tooth wasn't even cracked, and he showed me the X-ray that showed how it was in fact not cracked & was just a cavity. I was shocked and disappointed that dedicated dental would recommend a procedure that was totally unnecessary & so outrageously expensive. Long story short, I was a new patient at dedicated dental, and was quoted around $3000 worth of dental work after my first consultation with them. The simple filling at the other dental office cost me $192 in comparison to a $2000 risky and costly root canal procedure. The other dentist also said I did not have any signs of serious gum disease and that all I needed was a regular cleaning which is also less than $200. Clearly, (or at least in my experience) D.D. was more concerned about making money & taking advantage of young college student by scaring them into take their advice.

Found a tick type of a bug on my body after sleeping in bed first night. Talked to front desk staff and was told they had no issues with bed bugs or any other type of bugs and they had no rooms to move us nor were there any rooms in any other hotel. They said the ""bug"" expert was not there and they would do a check the next morning when this person arrived.. Several hours later we were getting ready for bed another tick type of bug was found on my husbands back. At this point we packed up our stuff and went to front desk with the bug in a bag to ""prove"" to them the existence of these bugs.  Again we were told maybe there was a room in the old house next door, that is a private residence, but they may have the same problem and the room is not large enough for all three of us. We were left without any accommodations and my 9 year old had a soccer game the next morning. We left the hotel at 9:30 pm and drove 45 miles to find a room.  The next morning I spoke to manager at the hotel. She saw the bug and said it was some sort of horse tick. There was a horse show in town earlier in the week and many horse people stayed at the hotel. She apologized for not believing us the first time we complained. This customer service was unacceptable and I don't understand why they don't clean or fumigate the rooms after horse shows. Also, I guess the idea that the guest is right is not part of their customer service. They didn't charge us for our stay, but did nothing to make up for our hour drive to find another hotel or offer to pay for the hotel we did find.",2011-08-24 17:55:45

This hotel is old, the rooms we were in had no windows and no lights on the ceiling. The cooling is just a switch up or down. All that, I can live with. My issues came with the randomness of service. Throughout the 4 days we were there, my cups and water were never replenished. I got a different number of towels every day. My mother swears there was a cockroach in her room. When we told the front desk about these things, they looked up from their phones and said ok then went back to their phones. It was the lack of service which has brought me to this low review.

I understand that this is supposed to be a ""cheesesteak"" which is of course going to be incredibly greasy, but I was hoping that since it's seitan and not beef, it could be made a bit cleaner. 
-Fries: Not awful, just very mediocre.

To be honest, things started off great with this dealership.  My wife and I went in at around 7pm on a Friday night with the intentions on buying a lifted truck. Found the truck I wanted right away and started working with a salesman to get the deal done. The first anomaly was, the internet listed price was $45,996, but when we went to make the deal, the truck was now $55,222. Weird, right? Over 10k difference! We were told the price is more because of the ""market"", but he tag in the front window said because of ""diesel adjustment."" The truck we bought isn't even a diesel! After these red flags we should've walked away, but talked them down to $52,711. While in finance, we mentioned to the salesman that the truck hadn't been detailed and there was also only 1/8 tank of gas in it. The dealer stated that the detailers had gone home for the day, which we understood, and he also gave us $20 cash to put gas in it. We ended up spending $72 to fill it up... It gets worse..

We noticed the next day that the alignment was clearly off, as the two front tires were pointed inward from the bottom (toe issue/out of alignment). We took it back to the dealership and spoke to the same salesman that sold us the car and he said he had to ask the manger if there was anything they could do. For starters, we literally just bought the truck and these things, like alignments, should be done if the vehicle is on the lot, ready to be sold. The salesman suggested that we use our warranty, but I respectfully declined, as we would have to pay a deductible. I should not be paying out of pocket for a truck that I just bought! Am I crazy?? The salesman went back to talk to the manager (Alex) and the salesman told us to take it to the service department and they would take care of me. The salesman also wanted me to leave my truck for 3 days so they can perform the alignment. Insane! An alignment should only take an hour or so, NOT 3 days!

After everything, I've decided to take my truck to another shop and pay out of pocket, because this dealership clearly doesn't have their act together. Believe me when I say, Quebedeaux will be reimbursing us for having to pay for the alignment. The Manager is totally avoiding us and the salesman's attitude and helpful manner changed since the car has already been purchased. 

Our first mistake we made was when we decided to even step foot on this car lot, as we have purchased three vehicles from Mercedes Benz of Tucson and have always been treated remarkably. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID! Don't purchase a vehicle from Quebedeaux because if you do, you will definitely regret it. Sure wish there was a way to list zero stars because one star is too much...

Good luck Yelpers!

UPDATE AS OF 5/13/21

Changed from 1 star to 2 stars, and here's why:

We spoke to a lady by the name of Shelly, in one of Quebedeaux's departments,  to see about getting reimbursed for paying to have the alignment fixed. Shelly is definitely Quebedeaux's saving grace because we were really close to contacting the BBB. We're so glad we were able to speak with Shelly as she got approval from a Manager to reimburse us, without any issues. Thank you Shelly, you are wonderful!",2021-05-04 01:28:47

No server no assistance not even a drink order for some water the very least. 3 servers pass and no one makes a attempt to assist and see what's going on. Myself being in the industry I know to work as a team and let my colleagues know they have a table to wait on so I naturally have more patience and try not to be that table or person who gives a hard time. Almost 20 minutes and nothing. Host comes by clears a table next to me and I have to ask if I can see my waiter and still no one, someone else comes by but it's not my server and offers two waters that weren't for us. After all this still no server and table next to us was also lost looking around so At that point I knew it was time to leave I was not gonna spend a dime there.

The food is not made to order, or anything approaching it. On the contrary, the food is simply removed from hot boxes (this is probably not the appropriate terminology, but I am referring to metal containers with hot water underneath to keep the food warm), then sliced and served to the customer. Hence, is is more accurately described as cafeteria food.

The food itself is of very poor quality. The meat is over-salted and otherwise flavorless. It is served warm at best (certainly not hot). The BBQ sauce is nothing special, and leaves much to be desired.

I ordered a Carnival platter (a mix of chicken, sausage and pork). Worst of all was the chicken. Rotisserie chicken from a local grocery store would have been superior. Popeye's would have been far superior. Alas, my fountain root beer was the highlight of my meal.

No scrub or anything like I had had the first time. When taking off my gel on my fingernails the nail tech cut my cuticles too close on my pinky and couldn't understand what I was wanting done. Simple polka dots on my ring finger. When I checked out and was told how much it was I tried to explain that my pedicure did not warrant the price and I was basically told too bad.

I absolutely LOVE their food.  And the video games are my son's favorite.

I've been here three times, the first time I asked for a substitution.  I asked to order a sandwich (with sprouts, avocado, cream cheese and lots of other stuff) without meat.  My daughter is a vegetarian.  At that time we hadn't noticed the veggie offerings on the board.

The cashier told me that there wouldn't be much of a sandwich left if we took the meat off.  He said ""The meat is the base of that sandwich.""

So we ordered something else.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized that what we ordered from the veggie offerings was nearly identical to the other sandwich I ordered, just without meat.  

Kind of annoying.

Second trip was uneventful.

The third time I went in, I had been ill for nearly two weeks and this was my first trip out of the house for any reason whatsoever.  I'd been craving their sandwiches, but wanted to pick something that sounded good and would be somewhat gentle on my tummy.  Chose a sandwich I liked, and asked for it without avocado.  I don't like avocado.  The sandwich had lots of other ingredients.  As far as I could tell, the avocado was a topping, in addition to meat, cheese, lettuce, sprouts and other ingredients that I don't remember right now.

The girl on the other side of the counter said, ""The avocado is like . . . the BASE . . . of that sandwich.  We can't make it without avocado.""

OH I GET IT!

This is their schtick.  ""We don't like making substitutions so we claim the sandwich cannot be made without whatever it is you want to take off.""  



So I left, without a sandwich.  I was still feeling less than 100%, I wasn't in the mood to stand around and figure out another thing I could order.  



My bad experience aside, their sandwiches are very good.  The vibe is fun.  But if you're not friends with the owner (or manager, or whomever works the counter), you'll feel out of place and like you're intruding.  

The prices are quite high, too.  Defintiely only for a special treat, and only if you like avocado.",2012-08-20 05:10:52

Tonight we had a waiter that we have had before and he is usually really attentive and good. Tonight he was training someone and we could tell he was having an ""off"" night. 
It took 20 minutes to get our food order in after we got our drinks. I sat with an empty glass for 15 min and had to get the attention of the trainee to get a refill. I also thought that refills have to be brought in a fresh glass due to Covid but he took my glass refilled it and brought it back. 
When my friend placed her order she asked for a small cup of sour creamTogo with her plate. 
When the food came out there was a cup of cheese on my husbands plate and no sour cream for my friend. 
My husband gave my friend the cup thinking it was her sour cream and it was cheese. We had to ask for the sour cream.  No one came back to the table again to check on anything. My friend was like here take the cheese I'm not going to eat it. So my husband ate it. 
After 20 more minutes we asked for the checks. My friend was charged $1.99 for the cheese that she didn't order. When she brought it up to the waiter he said ""but you ate it"" my friend orders the same thing ever time she goes there. Most waiters know what she wants before she even orders it. When the waiter came back to the table he brought the manager with him and stated the cheese has to be paid for.  The service was the worst we have ever had-which was expressed to the manager. It was apparent he didn't care. I get that the waiter is a good waiter but we all make mistakes. Why not take ownership of the error?  But to argue that my friend ordered cheese sauce when she clearly didn't  was ridiculous. 
Like I said we would drive 45 minutes just to eat here. And we were trying to help a restaurant during times of low restaurant income. Well, not for me anymore. My $50-$75 will be spent elsewhere because apparently they would rather argue over $1.99 than do the right thing.

1) No matter how quick you pay your payments, most of the time you end up being late and you get an astronomical late fee added to your balance. 

2) Customer service is rude and they all have attitude problems.

3) We have had over 15 leases with many different lease companies in the past 20 years which all have been dollar buy out leases. we have never had any  lease company ask for the final ONE DOLLAR. it is basically a formality..

My lease with Marlin leasing was a five year  Dollar Buy out lease. Last full payment was sent in March of 2012. Suddenly, in May of 2013 we receive a bill for approx. $160. we call in and we are told that the buy out was not paid. Therefore we have accrued a late fee.
After more than a year later they suddenly decided to charge us approx. $160.00 as a late fee because the final ONE DOLLAR was not paid. We never received a bill for the final ONE DOLLAR buy out either. when we called in we were told that's how it is and we need to pay the late fee.

4) The original lease broker who wrote the contract over 6 years ago will no longer deal with them either.

5) We receive MULTIPLE automated calls EVERY DAY from Marlin Leasing claiming that we have a past due balance. Our phones are being answered by our customer service personnel and this tactic makes management look bad to our employees.

So we gave it a try. We need to call him and find out what's going on in that head of his. Or maybe there's been a huge issue with the second location? 

We went to the counter and ordered. I'm always a little irritated when a counter service place asks for tip before you've even had any service, and the lowest grat offered on their Clover POS was 15%. To be clear, all they're doing is running food out, and we generally don't tip food runners. But okay. 

There issues with the POS system and the owner/manager had to get a little tutorial from the girl working the other station. But it took us a little time to order. We ordered a Bayou Crepe, a Hangover, and, since there was no signage in the bakery case, had to do a bit of pointing and ""no, what's this one?"" to figure out what was in there. (PS everything was banana nut bread.) We ordered a little banana nut flat cake thing (not a loaf) and took our number and went to our table. Asked for waters while we waited so felt better about that 15% tip. 

We were right by the door and ended up moving. It was clearly clean the patio day and mops and squeegees were coming in and going out. I love cleaning, but it was just a lot of traffic. 

Food came out fast, and as it turns out, too fast. My Bayou Crepe, a crepe filled with crab augratin, came out first and I let it hang for a minute while my husband's food came out. Coffees came out in paper cups. Husband's Hangover arrived, and this savory waffle topped with grits, scrambled eggs, and soy sausage looked gorgeous. The gentleman who had rung us up delivered the waffle and said ""enjoy!"" and we had to ask for the banana nut thing. So no one is expediting. But apparently, no one is actually cooking either. 

This food was microwaved. The crepe, despite the pan marks, was not crisp anywhere. Not on the pan marks, not on the edges. It was soggy, like a gas station burrito. The flavor of the filling was incredible, but the disappointment in the consistency wasn't something I could get past. My husband's waffle had crisp looking brown edges and they were just soggy too. We don't know if the food is cooked at the original location and then brought over just to be heated here (there is a Waffles on Maple van parked out front that would work great for this), but it's a shame.  The flavor in everything was quite good but there was no texture - it was just hot glop. And I don't mind a bowl of stew but not when I've ordered a waffle or a crepe. I also don't mind paying $40 for breakfast but that stings when it's not made fresh.  

The banana bread was no better. The walnuts tasted old and we didn't come close to finishing it. Cafe at lait was just non-chicory coffee with cream and the cappuccino was a latte. 

It was like eating in the airport. Everything sounds amazing, the place looks cool, but seating is tight, food is cooked off site and microwaved, and is overpriced for what you actually get. We won't be back, but are quite curious about the other location.",2017-04-03 16:35:25

We got ready to leave/ pay and bartender couldn't be found anywhere.  My husband had to go and search around for a manager, hostess, anyone to help us pay.  We did talk to her about his behavior and she comped our drinks which was nice.

I find it interesting that there is a similar review on here about the bartender being such a mess and it has to be the same guy.

She takes the debit card manually enters the number into computer and tells me it was refused to call my bank, and that she just processed the card on file. I call the bank she never ran my card number so she must have entered it incorrectly yet she rushed us and put it on the card on file without us agreeing. When she did it incorrectly.

So I try lost and found again to my shock someone actually answers and she tells me she has no idea why I got an email they don't use that system anymore and that she seen my report but she has been to busy and she may try to look in 2-3 days and she will only call me if she finds it. So I had to pay to park at the airport waste my time in line to get another run around from this company. 

THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST COMPANY. There customer service employees are rude and improperly trained. The managers don't call you back.",2017-07-21 23:56:00

Then we were hastily seen by a nurse who didn't even look me in the eyes when asking my son't medical information. The PA (Maria Mosos) didn't come in for another 20 minutes and then rushed out again after seeing us for less than 5 minutes, only to leave us waiting for another 15 minutes!

I am not one to write reviews although I feel I should have written reviews on several experiences that I've had from restaurants to cosmetic experiences. After this experience I questioned whether it was with my time.

I literally just walked into ""Eliza's Dominican Hair Salon"" without an apple (and they say no appt' needed) and there was ""ONE"" person washing a clients hair and ""two"" workers sitting in clients chairs on their phones as I walked in. As I stood there bewildered as to whether I should approach someone or just sit down,!they all just stared at me for nearly 10 seconds before I opened my mouth) So I politely said ""Hi...and stated my hair requests, than was asked/motioned to just take a seat...nothing more like ""someone will be right with you"". 

Needless to say, I was dissatisfied with the client-relationship and merely stated ""I'll be back later""  It was then that movement began and one worker stated she'd  almost finished washing a clients hair, by then I had already checked out and didn't really trust them as a business much less one that took interest in my hair.

I'm very big on customer service and am not hard to please, but its the small things that should come natural that turn me away,  and I believe it's for a purpose. I wish them well, but I don't think their services would serve me well, thus my rating of 1/5. 

Customer service begins at the door, hands down! Good Bye Eliza! Wish your business well! Hopefully you can encourage your workers to get off their phones and engage their clients that will bring in business, cause at this point, you're losing them!!",2016-03-03 21:11:26

Service was horrible. Hostess was sweet but server did t come over to even greet us for well over 5 min if not longer (and was MIA the whole meal). 
The tomato app was good but the paella was beyond horrible and insulting to claim it was saffron rice w fresh veggie. What it tastes like was microwaved gooey rice a roni w frozen premixed assorted veggies. I guarantee it . It was all the classic ""stir fry"" veggies and were limp and bland. 
We never send anything back, esp when we are hungry like we were. We politely tell the server when she finally checks in on us 20 minutes later (apps were all gone, drinks were empty) that we're sorry but it's simply not what we expected or what was listed and we probably won't eat any of it. I asked if the veggie are frozen and she shrugged like idk. 

The sangrias were so watery, small, and had zero fruit. They were not what either of us had received in the past at Barcelona so initially we thought we got the wrong drinks. We drank them bc it's whatever but I would not recommend them to anyone. Whoever made those drinks did not know what they were doing 

Bill comes and told us she wouldnt take off the paella despite her taking the entire entree from us that we only had 4 bites of. She said ""it's just not something we do."" Then 1) don't take our entire entree without telling us we are still forced to pay for it and we didn't eat any of it 2) stop serving embarrassing food. I couldn't believe they felt good sending that out in the first place. Finally she's like I'll see what I can do and easy enough manager removes it . So between that, that lack of personality, and the inattentive service we were shocked. Her name was Megan and even if it was busy , which it wasn't inside, why does the customer have to deal w that. Whole experience was bad. 

I have served and bartended in Stl and did in Clayton for a couple years even so ya I understand serving and am really relaxed if things are busy or something's going on but in this case the whole experience was bad.

To top it off we were sat right next to the bar so we got to watch the bartender scarf down a meal in plain view in between making drinks and not washing his hands. Do that in the back that was gross to watch and unprofessional.

Jeanie is the main manager I guess and she absolutely sucks at helping or even explaining anything to her customers. All she did was yell at mine and my roommates faces when we were asking her questions. They do not care for the people living here they only care about the money. DO NOT come here if you're looking for an apartment. There are several other different complexes around this one so I would suggest checking them out and NOT the enclaves unless you want to get rigged for your money.",2019-06-06 01:01:23

However that was not to be and now I need to warn you all about it.
Strike one...beer on tap was flat and stale.
Strike two...bottled sauces on table all had different labels so we thought we would see which one we'd like to sauce our meat with.  they were so watery, dared not pour any out and all had the SAME vinegary smell.  skip the sauce.
Strike three...Baked Beans were  served cold.  When we sent them back for heat up, they came back with funny taste to them....Tasted like the spice thyme was added to it.  Who puts thyme in baked beans???  I guess we should be glad (or hope) that no one peed in them before reserving.
Strike four....yes there is more.... the meat, pork ribs and some special that looked like a caveman bone, were tasteless.  They told us the rub was glutten free.???  well it could have used some glutten maybe.   They kept asking if everything was fine and we got tired of complaining about everything so just let it go at the time.

I'll start off by saying it didn't become a disaster until about 20-30 mins after my party started. When I arrived (early) our tables and area were set up for us. I did my mom thing and put my own decorations on etc. 

SO party is starting and a short African American male wearing a white tucked in button up tells me that he's not a party host and has never hosted a party and this will be his first time. RED FLAG. Even if this is your first time hosting, you don't tell your guests that. I asked him who will be servicing the area we were sitting in, he informed me that my guests had to use the tablets on the table to order food, as he was only taking care of the kids. Okay, cool, understandable. 

It was downhill after that....my parents ordered food at 5:45 and did not get their food until F'N 6:30!!!!! WTF?! The kids went to play laser tag at 6:15, I gave the clipboard with the kids names and what they wanted to drink to our 'party host'. I requested that the drinks be out by time the kids got finished with laser tag (15-20 mins), because I knew they would be thirsty. Kids are out of laser tag, no drinks. I asked our 'host' for an update on the food and he tells me the food will be out in 30 mins. Okay cool, so I send the kids to the arcade. After 45 mins in the arcade the food is still not at the table. At this point its pushin 7:30/7:40 and we do not have food for the kids or the guests that ordered food from the tablets. An entire birthday party is waiting around for food. 

I speak with the manager, short heavy-set guy in a blue button up. He tells me there was a shift change and that basically he's sorry things are so messed up and he will try his best to push things along. He gave us 13 additional game cards for the kids to go to the arcade with in the meantime. When our food finally did come out they only brought out half of the kids sliders. So the other half was sitting at the table watching all of the other kids eat. And none, NOT A ONE basket came out with the fruit cups. The 'host' had to go back to the kitchen and bring them out two by two-after I brought it to his attention! How in the FFFF did 13 slider baskets come out of the kitchen with NONE OF THEM HAVING FRUIT?! The service was so terrible we had to get our own refills!! 

I booked my sons 8th birthday party on 8/30/19 for a party on 9/14/19. Why weren't there enough staff scheduled to take care of the guests that were confirmed to be there? If we're ordering food from the tablets, the order goes straight to the kitchen-per the manager, so what was the hold up on getting the food to the tables? Why were parties booked without a sufficient amount of party hosts for the parties, wtf? 

This was by far the worst birthday my son has ever had. I was so busy chasing down food and servicing the kids I didn't get any pics of my sons birthday party or a chance to catch up with friends and family. WTF is the point in having a party host if the parent has to host? I could've had it in my backyard if I knew this was the type of service I was going to get. SAVE your money people! It was a nightmare. Our experience was horrible, nothing went well AT ALL!",2019-09-17 19:57:31

My husband and I were in the mood for pizza tonight and decided to give this place a try because it's super close to our apartment. We ordered online with no issues and my husband went to go pick it up. When he arrived they had incorrectly made one of our pizzas. They graciously offered to remake it and offer a $5 credit to our account. The issue is that when they ""remade"" it they took the same pizza which was now cold, and topped it with mushrooms. Because my husband had to wait for them to ""remake"" part of the order the whole thing was cold when he got home (we live 5 minutes from the restaurant). I said it was fine and started to eat because it wasn't a big deal. After taking one bite of cold pizza with the toppings LITERALLY falling off I decided to call the restaurant and talk to someone because they must care about the quality and happiness of paying customers, right? WRONG. I asked to speak to a manager. I was put on hold and then the ""manager"" picked up. He started by saying he was really short staffed and he wasn't ""trying to be rude"" and asked what was wrong. I got out half of a sentence and he cut me off saying ""I gave your husband a $5 credit"" and I politely asked if there was anyone else I could speak to since he was busy. He HUNG UP ON ME!!! So shocked. I called back and asked for ""the manager's name so I could call someone else and file a complaint and this guy tells me HE IS THE OWNER and hung up on me again! WHAT IN THE WORLD!?! I am so shocked at this entire experience and honestly disgusted. First of all, you got the order wrong. Secondly, a $5 credit does nothing for me because we spent over $30 on cold, ruined food that isn't even correct because the toppings are falling off. Thirdly, the actual owner of a location hung up on a paying customer twice when the store was 1000000% in the wrong. I am going to spread this review around to every social media platform I can and complain to everyone who will listen until I get  my $30 back from this jerk. What a horrible experience. It's so sad that we wanted to try somewhere other than a regular chain to see if it was any good and I honestly wish we'd ordered from Pizza Hut. What an experience! If this guy is really the owner he needs to get his priorities in order because paying customers are what makes his business successful. Won't be back everrrrrrr.

The food and beers are delicious, although a bit expensive for a beer/pub style restaurant. However, I have found myself frequenting this place less and less (especially after work) because of the service, or to be better put, lack thereof.  If you sit in the bar area anytime after five on a weekday you won't have a server for about ten minutes and probably won't order food for about twenty minutes.  They seem to be dreadfully understaffed every time I go.  I'm not sure if they don't have enough employees to staff properly, or if the servers just want the floor to themselves to try and increase their tips, but it is dreadfully slow.  This ironic since I tip less and order less then I normally would.  

With that said, there's an easy solution to get this rating back up...  schedule another server when you're busy!",2013-04-23 16:55:06

Tried to change from what I ordered to a cheaper set. (They had not even ordered the proper ones at the time of install.) SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT EVEN THINK OF USING THIS COMPANY. Have it done locally for a much cheaper price, and buy your wife a new wardrobe with the money you save. They are overpriced and they under deliver.  In my opinion this is an awful deal all the way around, they talk a good talk and that is all. I contacted them about my concerns and was told they would call back by the end of the week. Did not happen, in fact I did not even hear from them till I posted this. I was told these were small problems, maybe to them, not to me. This all was right after the Job was completed.

Now we go to a few months later. If you need something fixed under warranty, forget it, you get the run around for weeks, three weeks three broken promises, did not even bother to call and let me know he was not coming. The fourth week they did bring a new shower head, the old one was squirting up to the ceiling, but the new one was chrome and did not work any way, and I have brushed nickel not chrome. Made him aware of that and was told he would be down the following week, that was weeks ago. No word from them, so I went and bought one myself.

Well, except for the summer of 1984 when our family spent two months in India for my father's work. There was only one pizzeria at that time (in a city with the population of Chicago) trying to emulate what we ate in the states and it wasn't great. But we were desperate and ate it weekly.

I admit that I'm jaded, having now eaten 8 of the top 10 pizzas as ranked by Epicurious.com (who thankfully guided me to Southwest Connecticut for the two best pizzas on the planet, yes even better than Italy itself). I've had nearly every pie you can try in Music City, so I have quite a bit of comparison.

I laugh at the other ratings that bestow Sir Pizza with anything higher than 2 stars and I wonder if these people have even been to Lombardi's in New York or Frank Pepe's in New Haven. Or heck, Joey's House of Pizza just 8.3 miles east of this Sir Pizza. I mean come on people!!! If Sir Pizza is a 4 or 5, then what the heck is Joey's??? Don't abuse the Yelp rating system like that! I imagine you consider Papa John's as the ultimate gourmet meal.

Anyway, the pizza is terrible, even worse than Little Caesar's or Domino's, tasteless, poor quality cheese and sauce, etc. and I sincerely question anyone who rates this place as anything above ""Eek! Methinks not.""",2016-03-11 14:12:41

However, I'm finished with the Mooresville location. The last three times I've been to the Mooresville restaurant for dinner, we've been asked to wait 20-30 minutes when there are several tables and booths completely empty.

The first two times my wife and I reluctantly agreed to wait. The third time was this past Friday night 6/15/18. Same story. There were four girls in the age range of 18 standing around the hostess station talking.  To begin with, they acted like it we were inconveniencing them to ask for a table. But we insisted on interrupting their conversation nonetheless. We got the same story. It will be 20-30 minutes. This time I specifically counted 4 booths and 5 tables totally empty and clean waiting for someone to sit down. This time, unlike the last two times I said enough is enough and left. 

When we left there were 9 people sitting waiting in the wait area. The four girls continued their conversation as we were walking out. All I can say is get someone to manage this place that knows how to run a restaurant. If you don't have enough people to cover the empty tables have one of the four young girls get to work and serve the customers instead of conducting their little high school gossip session at the hostess station. 

As I stated, this is not a one off occurrence it has happened to my wife and I three times in a row in 6 weeks. Therefore I have to assume it goes on all the time. I will not set foot in that location again in Mooresville. I will most certainly continue to visit the other two locations in that they seem to have managers that know how to run a restaurant on a Friday night, arguably the busiest dining out night of the week. 

I certainly welcome any contact by the management of this establishment by phone, email or text. I promise you that you'll get much more of an earful than I gave you here due to the format.  I can't say with enough emphasis, avoid this place unless you're up for a nice long wait even when they aren't busy.",2018-06-17 23:58:03

I was placed under the dryer. When my nails were dry, I stood up to walk out. Nobody thanked for me for my business or anything.

Then when walking back to use the restroom, saw at least ten empty tables... meanwhile, the front area, sidewalk outside, entryway, etc., was crammed with people waiting for tables, to the point where it was difficult to move or enter/exit the building. Basically... this was a fire hazard. When we were finally seated, we ordered but then were completely ignored for another 35 minutes. My father tried to talk to the manager about the long wait for our food, the manager proceeded to be rude and inappropriate to my father. My father is probably the most easy going and considerate man I know, and I witnessed the manager speak to him horribly as he came back to sit down, telling my dad that he was out of line for trying to talk to him. At that point, basically, the manager was insinuating that my father had been rude to him, and I saw him roll his eyes as he walked away. At this point, we still did not have our food, and I decided it was time to leave. I went up front and offered to pay for our drinks before we left. The manager said we didn't need to pay for drinks and that our food was coming right out. I said I didn't like the way he spoke to my dad and that we'd rather leave. He got very angry and countered that my dad said he was ""talentless"" and that he ""sucked"" and that he was defending himself. These phrases not only don't make sense with the situation, but are also words my father would never say and I'm sure never said. I said, simply, that the point is, we were leaving. I'm appalled about this service and the fact that this manager thought it was ok to bold faced lie to me about my own father. I can't speak to the food, since we never got the chance to eat any. 

Down the street, about two min walk, there's a place called 417 Union... we went there, were seated in less than five min, our food came quickly, was delicious, and the staff was wonderful.

Although my server was helpful and asked the chef questions to which she didn't know the answers, I was left with about two options in the end, both of which were salads.

And my gut tells me this place is just below average. 

My $12 Mohito, was clearly watered down, lacking both simple syrup and rum. Especially lacking rum. I think they may have forgotten the rum. 

The burger, in spite of being piled with ingredients, was nearly tasteless. It's like they chose the exact opposite of fresh local ingredients. At $14, it was downright horrible.   There is a place in Detroit where I can get two craft beers and the best burger I've ever had for less than $14.

Salmon pasta was exactly alright. Not bad, just nothing to write home about, which is exactly why I'm writing about it here. Would have been happy at $10, but not $18.

If I had only tried the salmon pasta, I may have given three stars. My guess is an Olive Garden salmon pasta would have tasted much better. 

Some reviewers called this a ""dive"" bar. No, this is not a dive, it's just crappy. A dive bar would serve great beer and tasty burgers for cheap, in an atmosphere where sidling up to the bar, ordering a shot of Jameson's, and rambling casually with the other local characters, was the norm. A dive bar does not make stingy drinks. 

The atmosphere reminded me of a casual bar restaurant you might find in a small town somewhere. Or it reminds me of numerous touristy ripoff places in Times Square. 

Bottom line, foodies, diners with discerning taste, and pretty much anybody who has taste buds should stay away.

Cons:
-When I checked in, exhausted after a long day, I was given a room that was already occupied. It was awkward when someone opened the room door from the inside while I was trying to open it from the outside.
-I dragged all my stuff back down to the lobby to get a new room. The new room was still on the second floor and even farther down the impossibly long corridor. The walk to the room seemed to last forever. I had hoped that they would give me a slightly nicer room (maybe a room with a slightly better view than the parking lot) considering that they made me walk into a room that was already occupied.
-The second evening, after returning from another long day, I trekked down the long hallway to the room only to find that the keys had been demagnetized. I wasted some valuable napping time getting replacement keys.
-Despite the fact that I told them I was the only one staying in the room, they had me down as ""Mr. Yi Z."" There was clearly no Mr. there.

After speaking to you on the phone yesterday, I am surprised this is your response. This reason I chose to continue to speak to Misha in the manner in which I did, which was extremely courteous was 1) To make a point that this is how adults interact in front of my daughter.  2) I could not recall the stylists name, and wanted to get her card. Which is what I did. And yes, she was being a b*tch, and therefore,  an accurate word to describe her behavior. Furthermore, I will be updating this review with a photo of my daughter's hair, which is not damaged beyond repair, and I will post a photo of the test strip which Misha did on the fly, to contest your erroneous excuses. Thank you for making the customer wrong and making an already horrible experience even worse. 

I guess the trick to having a positive experience here is booking an appointment with Erik. My eldest daughter really likes to dye her hair all sorts of colors, and when she recently needed some sprucing up, she went to Erik, and voila, she had gorgeous hair once again.

Unfortunately, I scheduled a consultation with Misha for my youngest daughter. Hence the one star. 

My youngest daughter, who very was excited about the prospect of getting her hair done, left The Color Room completely upset due to the way Misha treated her. To top it off, the two stylists working next to her were snickering, and relishing in what a complete b*tch Misha was being to my daughter, who is TWELVE YEARS OLD, for using Sun-In.

I have never experienced anything like this ever by a stylist. 

I highly suggest Misha and the snickering stylists do some work on yourselves because you are in the service industry after all. Fools.

FYI: There are plenty of other stylists in this town who are NOT rude to TWELVE YEAR OLD girls. We will not be returning to this establishment.

Now I understand the wait for food as I'm sure everyone showed up and ordered food at the same time, really bogged down the kitchen. I wouldn't have minded waiting the hour and half for food, as the server told us it would be, except when it finally did arrive it was less than mediocre. 
Wings were small, cold and absolutely no flavor. We ordered Nashville Hot, but it should have been more like mild.  Burgers were small, over cooked, served on a large stale bun, cold and slapped together with ""toppings"", paired with undercooked cold fries.

The pizza itself was good enough that if I came across it again I would eat it. But it wasn't worth what I had to go through to get it. And this is coming from a girl who drives two hours for good pizza. Trust me as a pizza lover I will go out of my way if I think it is worth it. Unfortunately, pizzeria beddia isn't worth what they put me through.

First of all, why in the world don't they have a phone? I can't think of a single legitimate business that doesn't have a phone. I would think that it's more of a hassle not to have one. It is definitely a hassle for their customers. I can't imagine that any person who eats there actually enjoys walking or finding parking there once to order, then a second time to pick up. I can't understand it. Its just more work for people who already have hectic schedules.

I would wait there except there is nowhere to sit and it takes an hour. I'm not complaining about the hour wait cause good work takes time. But I would rather call and wait at home. 

I would never eat there. There are no seats and it was not a welcoming atmospere. And the cashier was rude to me.

All in all good, but not that good. I won't be going back.",2013-07-12 00:21:55

- Punjabi - Filled with the blandest rice pudding I've ever tasted.
- Strawberry Shortcake - Did not taste a thing like strawberry shortcake! It was a regular yeast doughnut with pink glaze that didn't really taste like anything.
- Maple bacon - My boyfriend stole this one and said it was good. His tastes are less discerning than mine.

I've done teppanyaki countless times in several cities but never has it been this bad.

Let me start with my first impression: I walk in and stand patiently in the foyer. No one is at the bar or host stand. I can see into the dining room and only one table has any people around it, the rest are completely empty. I patiently wait for someone to greet me. And wait. And wait. I waited almost ten minutes before the hostess put down her phone and came from the back of the restaurant to see me. I would have walked out long ago but I was very hungry and had a serious craving for some teppanyaki.

I sit down, the only person as my table. It's deathly quiet as the other table eats in silence, not talking to each other. I order the filet and shrimp combo and ask if I can get miso instead of clear sour since I'm allergic to mushrooms. I wait a bit longer and get served clear soup. The server doesn't understand when I say I requested miso and can't have clear soup.

Finally the chef finally comes out  and starts cooking. No talking, no patter, no showmanship that I expect with teppanyaki. I would write if off except I watched him talk and entertain the other table, throwing shrimp into the air. With the cost of the meal i expect a bit of a show. He cooks in silence, plates my food and pushes it to me. That's when I notice my silverware doesn't even include chopsticks. What kind of Japanese restaurant doesn't offer chopsticks?

How as the food? The filet was actually good. The shrimp slightly overdone. The noodles served with my steak were so salty as to be inedible. The fried rice was flat and lacked any real flavor. While I was eating the check was shoved towards me. To be honest, the server made me feel rushed.

Pro: big plate of food, steak and shrimp were pretty good.

The food is interesting sounding, but average at best.  We were a party of 4.  One had the scallops, one had the ribs, one had the duck breast and one had the chicken.  The scallops were good, but only came with 3 large scallops.  The duck breast was very good and came with sweet potato dumpling.  The chicken was average - although it was the largest dish.  FInally the ribs were poor - you get 2 beef ribs that, while very nicely seasoned, was more gooey fat than meat.

As for the liquor issue.  We got to the restaurant early and had a drink at the bar.  3 people had wine - not a bad selection - and one person asked for a infused/flavored vodka.  They were told that they did not carry any infused vodkas (although the bar had easily 200+ bottles of liquor).  That could almost be ok, but for dessert one person asked for coffee and a shot of bailey's only to be told they don't have bailey's either.  Not sure how a restaurant/bar can say they don't have both infused vodka, nor bailey's

Service was an issue.  The waitress knew the menu but kept pushing the truffles (their special this month).  Once dinner was ordered it took way too long to come out.  We were enjoying conversation but we were about to complain when it finally came out (I checked my watch and discovered it took 45 minutes for the meal to be served).  By that time we had finished out initial drinks and ordered a bottle of wine for dinner.  By the time the wine came out we had already ordered desert (30 minutes later) - needless to say we sent the (unopened) bottle back.

Didn't figure it was a big deal because as I stated before, the store was pretty empty. The checker tells me that I'm ""more than welcome to get back in line once I have my chips"" because he's hit the complete transaction as I was asking him to hold off!

I wish my husband and I had never decided to do business with this store. We bought a recliner a couple of months ago and although our sales associate was very nice, the service we received after they had our money was absolutely awful. First of all, we received a delivery window that didn't work for our work schedule (they don't contact you to set one up, you just receive an automated call 24 hours before they are going to deliver your furniture. We called the delivery manager 4 different times and never received a call back. They did not try to deliver, and we finally had to call the sales department to speak to someone to arrange the delivery. We finally received the chair and I called customer service about how unnecessarily difficult the process was. Next, the chair had a leg that wasn't finished properly and had smudges of stain on it. They sent someone out to try to repair it in our home and that didn't work so they said we would have to send it back to them. Guess who you have to deal with? The same delivery team. This time we scheduled two different deliveries and they showed up at the wrong time for both. The last time, the person trying to deliver said someone would call to reschedule. Of course that didn't happen so this week I called customer service again and told the whole long story. I also told them they owed our salesperson an apology, because she lost the rest of our business because of their terrible service. The customer service rep told me the delivery manager is too busy and his phone is ringing off the hook all the time. Guess what would help that? 1. Quit trying to deliver furniture multiple times when people have told you they won't be there. 2. Hire another delivery manager instead of having about 30 sales people in the store at one time. I couldn't believe she thought that was a good excuse to give. It is very clear that Sprintz cares only about getting the sale and then let's everything be a hassle for their customers afterward. I told them on the phone this week that I would be leaving this review and also that we give up on having the chair fixed, because it's not worth the trouble. That's probably what they are hoping for. Both times I called the customer service rep said she would definitely let a manager know. Have we ever heard from a manager? Did they even offer to waive our shipping charge for all the hassle? We found a family owned store in Lebanon that offers no sales tax and free delivery right off the bat. We were about to buy a bed from Sprintz while all this was occurring and are so glad we found a place that actually seems to care about having our business. Try harder, Sprintz.",2017-11-18 13:00:03

the associate chelsey that assisted me kept adding things to my order that i did not ask for or want. the proper thing would have been to offer/explain the item or service to me not just assume and up my total. she wasn't paying for this purchase i was. a lot of the information she gave me was pretty inaccurate. 


i have been back twice since that visit. the 2nd visit the manager andrew was also pretty unhelpful because he was lost and unaware. the associate juan was flat out rude. 

the only reason i've returned is because it's where the purchase initiated and it's what makes sense considering i've had  issues. i don't want to continue to explain my problems to a new team of people. 

my final visit was to get my brand new screen protector replaced because it was already coming up. i told the initial associate the left side wasn't properly fitting and was told it just needed heat. well instead it was coming up and forming bubbles all the way down. 

i am happy with my purchases as they were what i wanted but to spend so much time and money i wish i could have had a better experience attached to them.",2020-01-12 16:02:36

Today was my first time, I was excited to try, certain I would love it. But I was disappointed. First, the regular chef was not working, so no specials, eggs benedict, things that looked so tasty on social media...but I was still pretty hopeful. I was in a group of 4...drink orders were taken from 3 of us, then the server walked away. Ummm...one more person at the table! SO my french press coffee was delicious, as were the beignets. My German Crepes probably were quite delicious when served, but since we had to wait at least another 5 minutes for the 4th entree. so all others got cold since we were all trying to be polite and wait :/   Never did anyone check back to see if things were ok...waited forever and finally had to ask for check.  So, sad about the way it all went...but I do see the potential and will give it one more go, and will hopefully give it a better review then.",2016-02-21 19:08:21

I was reflecting on my good experiences from the past. I was disappointed. The decor and layout was similar to what I recalled. The service was also. The service was excellent. It then fell apart. I ordered the shrimp sampler and a crab cake on the side. The crab cake fell apart and was difficult to eat. It did not taste much like a crab cake. The shrimp was only OK at best. The bacon wrapped shrimp was tough and chewy. The other style shrimp was OK. Only the rice tasted good. The prices were high. The overall experience was a big let down for me. It looks like it will be another 10 years before I visit another Joe's Crab Shack. At least my expectations the next time will be relative to a lower bar.,2019-07-25 23:48:19

I had time to use the bathroom, pay my bill, take a call, and send some emails before I received my undercooked hash brown casserole. I never knew it took that long to literally scoop out an order.

T9oIOr4wwn5hcBbCvjrjdw,xAjy22aSVgu2EB2cqGMe4Q,WYel6hMEEPNwzVUlVBacbw,2.0,2,0,0,"Post-remodeling review: After reopening in April (the remodeling didn't seem to change the store at all), they came out with a new menu. The new menu is pretty glitchy as when I tried to make a custom stir fry, the rice option didn't even show up at first for a good 5 minutes. They took out the black/brown rice mix and replaced it with a brown rice only mix, which was a bummer because black rice is a lot healthier and tasted a lot better too. Because I couldn't select rice in my custom stir fry, I tried one of the premade stir fries with rice. I tried to customize it, and when I removed one of the two veggies that the rice came with, my bill increased by $2. So if you decide to get less toppings, they actually charge you more. What kind of logic is that? For toppings they also only allow you to get one topping now instead of two toppings. They also raised the prices on everything as well.

I finally got my food after being frustrated with the new menu for a good 10 minutes. The old menu worked perfectly fine, so I'm not sure why they had to replace it. I went with a stir fry using the spicy garlic sauce. This time the food tasted extremely bland compared to before. The spicy garlic sauce didn't have the same zest that the old one had. Not only that, my stir fry had sauce only on the top layer where all the veggies and meat was. If I dug into the center of the container, it was just rice without any sauce or veggies/meat. Whereas before they mixed the veggies with the sauce and the rice before packing it in, mine had all the veggies and sauce mixed with the rice near the top while the rice in the middle had nothing. Basically you'd be stuck with plain rice after eating the top veggie/rice layer. You can't mix it either because they pack it in a tight takeout box.

So to sum it up, compared to before they remodeled the store, they increased the prices, charged you for what used to be free, made customizing your stir fry a pain in the butt, and makes worse tasting food now. This used to be one of my favorite places for a quick meal in Rittenhouse, but I think I'd rather go to Wok Works now.",2016-04-04 03:32:44

First off, they were great about scheduling cause I had to cancel a few times due to painters not being done. I had to leave the key for them to enter and leave so I was not there. I was charged $175 for two hours of work. 

I made a call shortly after the cleaning (which was wiping down inside windows and cleaning the hardwood/laminate floors) to say that they did not clean the bathroom and left a lot of paint on the floor. The paint came up with my nail so I knew it should come up if they cleaned the floors correctly. 

So they told me they would come back and they did, at almost 5:30 at night when they were scheduled for around 3pm. I showed them what still needed to be done and went downstairs to deal with a contractor. Five minutes later the 3 people walked outside and left. The bathroom still was not cleaned and there was still paint in front of the door. 

So what did they do for 2 hours? What did I spend $175 on? There was no follow-up with the company and if you want cleaning done right then skip this place!",2013-11-27 22:58:26

I ordered the Chicken & Roasted Garlic Alfredo pizza for delivery.  The pizza had chicken, lovely roasted garlic cloves, Alfredo sauce, bacon, and tomatoes and was surprisingly very bland.  I was pretty confounded because how can anything with garlic and bacon be so dull in taste?  I don't usually add the crushed red pepper and parm cheese packets to pizza, but I had to in this instance just to get some flavors.  The crust, however, was amazing -  not too thick but still nice and chewy and crisp on the bottom.  I gave them a star just for the crust.  I don't think I'll be ordering from Spitfire again anytime soon simply because there are other much tastier options available.",2020-04-29 14:08:09

So, I tell her so, and she says, ""well you could do paisley with it or blah blah blah"" - what lady?!  I know how to match prints, I'm asking DO YOU HAVE THIS COMFORTER?  ENGLISH, DO YOU SPEAK IT?
So, I tell her, fine, I'll go look again.

Go back, look at the wall, still not there.  My mom asks another lady for help and she comes up to me, so I greet her and start to tell her what I'm looking for only to be CUT OFF with ""ARE YOU REGISTERED WITH US?""
